Oculus VR, creators of the Rift virtual reality (VR) goggles, closed on a $75 million round of funding from Andreessen Horowitz to bring its product to mainstream consumers, according to Venturebeat . Spark Capital, Matrix Partners and Formation|8 also participated, and Oculus VR previously raised more than $2.4 million in 2012 on Kickstarter . The new money, along with the full-time focus of game icon John Carmack , is a big investment in not only bringing consumer VR to market, but also to make it a viable place for games — not just a one-off novelty product.
