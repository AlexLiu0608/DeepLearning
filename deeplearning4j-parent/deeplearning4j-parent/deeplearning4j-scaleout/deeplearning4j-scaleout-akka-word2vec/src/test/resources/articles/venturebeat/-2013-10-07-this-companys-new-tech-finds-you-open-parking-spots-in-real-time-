In the city, getting somewhere is only half the battle — and sometimes much less than that. Finding a parking spot can be an even bigger time-waster.
Not any more, if Israel-based Anagog has its way.
Via multiple apps and a service for developers to integrate into their own apps, Anagog has built a real-time service that knows when people are vacating parking spots, and where you should go to get them. The company calls it “the first living parking map of an urban center,” and says that its data has just been built into the Easypark app.

“We all saw what crowdsourcing did for traffic and navigation, and we are excited to see this concept brought to the world of parking,” says Ofer Tziperman, CEO of Parx , which makes EasyPark.
Clearly, he’s referencing another Israeli startup, Waze, which was recently bought by Google for about $1.3 billion . And, of course, the two would be perfect companions: Waze to help you find your destination, Anagog to get you parked once you get there.
Anagog has a variety of apps such as FindMyCar, 2Park, OTO, StopPark, and ParkDroid, which help people find their car again after parking. Clearly, data accumulated by those types of apps feeds into the open parking spot database, as does data from EasyPark and other partners. Altogether, Anagog says it has about 500,000 users, which enables it to do this:
Israel, of course, is one story. The company has about 100,000 users there, in a country of about eight million people. Getting good enough data for San Francisco, New York, London, or other global cities is an entirely other matter, with 400,000 Anagog users spread over the rest of the world.
Still, partnership like that with EasyPark will help — Parx currently works in 130 cities. But more partners will be needed.
“Anagog’s technology is a ready-made, global solution for navigation systems, cellular operators, map providers, car manufacturers, and municipalities, who are constantly working to provide tailored, real- time information to their audience,” says Yaron Aizenbud, Co- CEO of Anagog.
Anagog is currently raising a funding round.
