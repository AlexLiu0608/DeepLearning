Unless you’re all caught up on new episodes of AMC hit TV series Breaking Bad, checking your Twitter feed early Monday morning is going to be a bad idea — unless you like being inundated with spoilers.
Well, it seems Netflix has you covered regardless of how behind you are. Today the company debuted a new web tool, called Spoilerfoiler , that lets you log into Twitter to see your stream up updates from friends, family, and others, but that will now block out all mentions of new Breaking Bad episodes.
Here’s the official description:
“Behind on Breaking Bad? Now you can check your feed without fear. Any tweets with danger words get blacked out, as below. When you’ve caught up, it’s safe to go back to normal Twitter. Until Heisenberg comes knocking again on Monday.”
The tool isn’t perfect, but it’s bound to eliminate a lot of the spoilers from excited viewers a few days after the show airs.
It’s rare for Netflix to care about the traditional TV schedule — having said its customers prefer to “binge watch” an entire season of a show rather than wait for it to come out every week. However, earlier this year the company struck a deal with AMC to bring in new episodes of the final season of Breaking Bad after airing on TV in the UK and eventually in the U.S., too.  And now the company is in the unique situation of trying to provide a tool to thwart spoilers on new episodes. That said, I wouldn’t expect Netflix to do a lot of this in the future.
