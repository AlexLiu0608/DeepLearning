News-focused startup Mobiles Republic has just announced a $6 million second round of institutional funding. The round was led by Intel Capital with participation from XAnge Private Equity and Creathor Venture.
The company describes itself as “a leading global syndicator of trusted news apps for mobile devices.” Basically, that means the startup maintains a suite of news apps that aggregate content from trustworthy sources in journalism — the Associated Press, the Financial Times, etc. — as well as online outlets such as the Huffington Post.
News Republic, which serves up mainstream, general-interest news, is Mobiles Republic’s primary app. Its other offerings include niche-news apps for sports, women’s lifestyle, technology, and gaming.
And of course, the content is all real-time and personalized using fancy algorithms — all of which seems de rigeur these says for news apps. The startup also says its interface is uniquely elegant for consumers.
Here’s a look at the News Republic iPad app:
The apps are also available on iPhone, Android devices, and Windows devices.
If you’ve never heard of these apps or this startup before, that’s okay. Mobiles Republic is planning to use the $6 million to change that. In addition to product development, the funding will be used on sales and marketing, especially in the United States.
Mobiles Republic was founded in 2008 and is based in France. Its founder is serial entrepreneur Gilles Raymond.
