The service, called the Samsung Kids’ Mobile Network Powered by Fingerprint, will offer safe apps and games with an educational twist for kids ages 3 to 7. The partnership is a big endorsement by the South Korean electronics giant for Fingerprint’s fledgling safe and educational kids app service.
Fingerprint will customize its mobile app service for Samsung’s own select devices. The service will debut in Southeast Asia and Oceania in the first quarter of 2014. Like Fingerprint’s other kids services, it will offer a safe and fun environment for kids to play games and learn. Parents will be able to create a family account for multiple children and receive personalized reports on activity. They can also get content recommendations and control access for each child.
On top of that, Fingerprint is earmarking $1 million to support the integration and localization of kids apps and interactive books globally. The company will give that money to developers to help increase the quality and quantity of kids apps.
Samsung’s network will be part of its Kids’ Play-and-Learn Content Initiative, which is focused on developers.

“We are very excited about partnering with Fingerprint,” said Nicholas Wodtke, the vice president of content and services at Samsung Electronics Media Solution Center Southeast Asia and Oceania. “Asia has a young demographic base and a rapidly growing middle class. There are an estimated 50 million kids in the age group of 3-7 years in Southeast Asia. Samsung is focused on bringing to market a service that offers a safe mobile play and learn environment for kids.”
The partnership is part of Samsung’s global effort to deliver content and services that improve the user experience on its devices.
“Research has validated the importance of learning through play during the critical developmental years of kids,” said Gerald Cai, the head of Learning and Reading at Samsung Electronics Media Solution Center Southeast Asia and Oceania. “It is, however, challenging for parents to navigate the vast app universe to identify thoughtful and suitable apps for kids. Our goal for Samsung’s new kids’ mobile network is to offer parents peace of mind, knowing their kids will have meaningful play experiences that will help them to learn and grow.”
The first set of apps will be ready in the first quarter.
“We are very proud that Samsung choose Fingerprint to develop and deliver a new kids app network that will reach millions of Samsung devices in one of the fastest-growing mobile learning markets in the world,” said Nancy MacIntyre, the CEO and co-founder of Fingerprint. “This partnership, along with our content initiative, will help to reshape the kids app market by opening up new opportunities for developers who are creating the most engaging and entertaining kid apps for an entire generation born [with] mobile.”
With the launch of the Samsung Kids’ Play-and-Learn Content Initiative and through efforts with other partner networks, Fingerprint expects to bring 50 new developers from 20 countries to market in the next year. Fingerprint expects to unveil 200 new gaming apps, plus 50 interactive stories in 2014.
The collaboration between Fingerprint and Samsung was advised by Brian Sengel of Waller Capital.
