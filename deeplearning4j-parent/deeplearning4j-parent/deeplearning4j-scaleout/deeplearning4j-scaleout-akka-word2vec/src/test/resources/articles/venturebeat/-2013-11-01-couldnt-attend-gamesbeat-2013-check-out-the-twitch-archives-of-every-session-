GamesBeat 2013 is over, leaving a hole in our hearts, but that doesn’t mean we can’t all relive the two-day conference online.
Our partners at the gameplay-broadcasting website Twitch recorded the entire event, and the archive of every session from the main stage is live for you to enjoy now. We’ve chopped up the hours of video, making it easier for you to find the panel talk or chat that you’re looking for.
To watch the videos, just jump over to our profile on Twitch. The videos won’t expire, so feel free to watch them at your own pace.
For direct links to the videos for each specific talk, check the list at the bottom of this post.
This year’s GamesBeat was a huge event for us — especially online, where the Twitch broadcast had over 1 million views and 364,480 unique visitors. Those numbers are in addition to the scores of industry luminaries and bright minds that attended GamesBeat 2013 in person — over 500 in all.
Here’s one of the highlights from the show featuring gaming website Revision 3′s Adam Sessler chatting with the president of GameStop, Tony Bartel:
