On any given night in any given city, there are thousands of things to do.
Rukkus launched a ticket search engine for live events today, with tools for tracking your favorite performers, inviting friends to shows, and receiving personalized recommendations on upcoming events.
“Rukkus was born out of a general dissatisfaction with the disjointed nature of the online event discovery and ticket buying process,” founder Manick Bhan told VentureBeat. “The ticket buying experience has become increasingly complicated. Rukkus is a virtual concierge service that searches the entire ticket universe, recommends events according to their interests, and pinpoints the best-valued tickets for every event.”
The site aggregates event tickets from multiple sources and uses a analytics engine to figure out the best deals, by comparing a seat’s distance from the action to the price of the ticket. You can search for specific events in your city, or browse by musical genre. Rukkus plans to feature sports and theater tickets soon as well.
Users can also connect their music listening services like Pandroa, Spotify, and Rdio to the site, and Rukkus will create an “individually tailored” calendar of upcoming events.
Emerging artists use the site to post their shows, connect with their existing fans, and hopefully attract new ones.
The Internet threw the music industry into crisis mode by fundamentally changing how music gets distributed. It created more channels for people to discover, listen, and share music, and realigned the existing power and financial structures.
The biggest record labels saw their revenues plummet, but the amount of music being consumed and produced is at an all time high . Americans are spending billions of dollars on music a year, and live music sales are experiencing dramatic growth.
The internet has given small and independent artists greater opportunities to get their music in front of a wider audience. Donnie Dinch, who runs another music ticketing startup called WillCall , said in a recent interview that music consumption is now distributed among more artists than ever before.
With more artists and more shows, there arises the need for tools that help fans stay on top of shows in their city. Rukkus competes with WillCall, as well as Ticketfly , Songkick, Bandsintown, SeatGeek, and the recently launched Jukely .
It is a competitive space and Bhan said Rukkus’s aggregation technology makes it stand out, as well as its personalized recommendation engine and ability to do “quantitative analysis” of ticket value distinguish it from the pack.
Rukkus currently has an inventory of 2 million tickets around the world and features 71,735 performers.
Bhan spent years as a studio musician, transitioned to investment banking at Goldman Sachs, and is now working on Rukkus with fellow former investment banker (and cofounder) Joe Messineo, and third cofounder Angela McCrory.
Rukkus is based in New York City.
