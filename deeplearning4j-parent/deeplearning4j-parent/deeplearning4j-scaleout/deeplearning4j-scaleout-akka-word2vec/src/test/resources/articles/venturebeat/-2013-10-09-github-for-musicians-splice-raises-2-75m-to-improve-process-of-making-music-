Open source music community  Splice  opened its private beta today and announced raising $2.75 million.
Splice is kind of like a GitHub for musicians. It’s a community where musicians can create songs and samples, and everything is backed up and organized in the cloud. They can also share music, collaborate on projects with other members of the community, track changes, and receive feedback on their work.
“So many of the improvements in music technology are focused on creating sound and the live experience,” Splice cofounder Steve Martocci said. “Little time has been spent on improving musician workflows, which has led to an antiquated and fragmented process.”
Martocci previously cofounded group messaging service GroupMe, which sold to Skype in 2011. He and Splice cofounder Matt Aimonetti saw an opportunity to apply the same tools available for writing code to writing music. Splice has tools for editing, iterating, and experimenting on music, as well as connecting with fans and other artists.
Union Square Ventures led the round for this New York CIty startup, with participation from True Ventures, Lerer Ventures, SV Angel, First Round Capital, Code Advisors, Rob Wiesenthal, David Tisch, and Seth Goldstein.
Until now, Splice has worked with a small group of beta artists across a range of genres. The company opened up a wait list for the private beta today.
