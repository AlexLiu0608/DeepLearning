Summary:
The holidays are here, and in this week’s podcast we talk about how to connect your tree, build a water sensor and stop people like me from unwrapping their gifts early and in secret.
This week’s podcast has a holiday theme. I’ve had a challenging time reviewing connected hubs for the smart home this weekend, so I share a few things I learned with Kevin Tofel that might save y’all some headaches. He shared a $5 app that helped him bring a camera into his Insteon network and lets him control and see everything in his home in one app. It may prompt him to buy another few connected cameras to put around his house and seems like a good idea for other Insteon users.
After Kevin and I chat, we turn to a segment with Hugo Fiennes the CEO of Electric Imp who talks about connected holiday projects one could build. The Imp is a Wi-Fi module plus the backend cloud service, that companies can use to build connected devices. In our segment we talk about how to build a tweeting turkey, connected Christmas lights and more.
