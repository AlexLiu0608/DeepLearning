At this rate, there won’t be many surprises for Google and LG to reveal when they finally announce the Nexus 5.
A leaked service manual for the LG-built Nexus 5 confirms some rumored specifications — a 5-inch screen, a quad-core Snapdragon processor — and gives us our closest look yet at the device, reports Android Police .
The Nexus phones are typically the devices meant to lead the way for the next wave of Android innovation, and they also offer a “pure” Android experience without any annoying third-party software. Over the last year though, we’ve seen other Android phones quickly one-up the most recent Nexus smartphone, the Nexus 4 , which was heralded more for its cheap $299 off-contract price than any particular features.
Among the other specs, the manual shows mostly what we were expecting: 2 gigabytes of RAM, an 8 megapixel camera with optical image stabilization, a hefty 2,300 mAh battery, and NFC. I’m hoping the camera is a significant step up from the Nexus 4′s disappointing shooter.
Judging from the specs, it looks like the Nexus won’t offer anything truly innovative — it’s more of an upgrade to the Nexus 4 — but it will be the most powerful way to get a pure Android experience. For most consumers though, the Moto X may be a better option, thanks to its always-on voice recognition capabilities.
Google is expected to officially announce the Nexus 5 within the next few weeks (especially since the Nexus 4 is no longer available on the Google Play store). Take a look at the full leaked service manual below:
