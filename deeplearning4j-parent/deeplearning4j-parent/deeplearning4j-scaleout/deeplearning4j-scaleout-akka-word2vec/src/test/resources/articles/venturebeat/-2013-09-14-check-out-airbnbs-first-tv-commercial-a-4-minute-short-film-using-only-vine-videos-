The social bed and breakfast startup Airbnb has just released its first attempt at television advertising, which pretty much looks nothing like the average 30-second annoying commercials you’re typically used to.
First of all, the commercial (if you can really call it that) is about 4 minutes long and composed entirely of 6-second videos made on the Twitter-owned short video service Vine. Airbnb gave its users instructions via Twitter to shoot these short Vine videos for the film, each of which depicts a different scene with a paper airplane traveling across the world.
The video’s plot is to show how everyone is finding their place in the world, the company told AllThingsD . That’s definitely fitting considering that Airbnb’s business is in making people’s spare rooms, guest homes, etc. look far more appealing than staying at hotels when traveling.
Airbnb’s commercial aired on the Sundance Channel earlier this week, and can been viewed in the embedded YouTube video below.
