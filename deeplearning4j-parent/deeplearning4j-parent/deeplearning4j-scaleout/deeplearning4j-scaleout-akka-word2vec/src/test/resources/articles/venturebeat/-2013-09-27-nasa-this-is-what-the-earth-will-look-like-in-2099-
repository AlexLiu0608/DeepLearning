NASA has just put out a time-lapse video showing how the changing climate is expected to impact our world between now and 2099.
Based on the agency’s models for climate and weather trends, NASA predicts that temperatures and rainfall will change drastically during the century to come. Globally, temperatures are expected to rise significantly. Precipitation will increase and decrease differently for various locations around the globe.
The end result: Your grandkids’ world is likely going to be a lot different from the one we live in now — and it won’t just be the crappy music.
