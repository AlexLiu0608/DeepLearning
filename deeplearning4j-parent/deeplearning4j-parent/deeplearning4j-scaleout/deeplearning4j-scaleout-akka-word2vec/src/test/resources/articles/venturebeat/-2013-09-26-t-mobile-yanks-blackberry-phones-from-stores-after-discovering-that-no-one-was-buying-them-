This one’s gotta sting.
T-Mobile is giving up on selling BlackBerry phones in its retail stores. T-Mobile corporate services VP  David Carey told Reuters on Wednesday that T-Mobile is giving BlackBerry phones the boot after finding out what most of us already suspected: People just weren’t buying the things. T-Mobile wants to put that shelf space to better use.
It’s not all bad, though. Carey also confirmed that T-Mobile will continue selling BlackBerry phones online, focusing on business customers who don’t tend to make their purchases in-store.
That, coincidentally, meshes pretty well with the new “enterprise and prosumer” strategy BlackBerry announced alongside its disastrous earnings preview last week . Looking at the numbers, the company’s shift in focus makes sense: BlackBerry said it sold 3.7 million phones last quarter (that’s less than half  the number of smartphones Apple sold in one weekend , mind you). Most of those devices, however, were BlackBerry 7 phones, not ones running BlackBerry 10, where the company is really staking its future.
In other words, BlackBerry’s consumer strategy just hasn’t worked all that well — hence it’s struggle.
As has been clear all along, if BlackBerry wants to survive in any form, it has to think smaller and focus on what it’s good at: business services and integrated hardware.
Oh, and while T-Mobile is giving up on BlackBerry, Verizon and AT&T aren’t. Both companies confirmed to AllThingsD  that they aren’t following T-Mobile’s lead on this one.
