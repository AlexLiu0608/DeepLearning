You’re not going to find the most popular Silicon Valley startups on this list. In fact, you’re not going to find any Silicon Valley startups.
Turnstone , a company that helps you design your workspace, took a survey of soliciting nominations for the best young startups to work for . Startups qualified as “young” if they were less than 10 years old and had fewer than 100 employees. You couldn’t nominate your own startup and once the nominations were in, the startups would be further scrutinized by a team of five judge.
Theses judges looked at if the business had the potential grow, if it had a good culture, if its workspace was enjoyable, and how its leadership is structured.
Surprisingly, however, none of the final startups are located in the Bay Area, which breeds hundreds of startups.
“There is no doubt there is a huge mass of great companies being built every day in the Bay/Silicon Valley area, but we are convinced that like a virus (a good one) that over the last few years this has spread,” said Kevin Kuske, the general manager of Turnstone.. “The companies we hear about that are household names make up a tiny fraction of the actual number of ‘innovation driving enterprises’ that exist.”
So who made the list? Check them out:
Chalkfly — Detroit, Mich.
Chalkfly is pretty much like Staples, but all online. It sells school and office supplies, as well as technology. You can purchase as a regular consumer or as a business. Chalkfly gets interesting, however, as it donates five percent of your purchase price to schools and teachers in the United States. The money goes directly to that school or institution and you get to decide who gets it.
Cloudability — Portland, Ore.
Managing and running cloud infrastructure can get really expensive. In fact, you might just need a second budget just to keep track of this spending alone. That’s where Cloudability comes in. Its accounting technology tracks and analyzes all of your cloud spending and analyzes this activity. It’s only funny that Cloudability is, in fact, another cloud service that you need to pay for.
Fanology — Los Angeles, Calif.
Fanology is a social media marketing firm that says it will help you tell your story through the tweets, shared pictures, and more that your company and its fans share every day. It will analyze your current social media usage, think up a new strategy for your brand, and can even build special apps and other interactive digital elements to help push your messaging forward.
Greatist — New York, N.Y.
Health is going full speed toward digital and Greatist wants to be a part of the charge. The company is building a health hub filled with information and articles about fitness and health that it says has all been “cited by a scientific student and every sentence approved by multiple experts.” It was to be the place you trust to get fitness information.
Groove Commerce — Baltimore, Md.

The company works best with those who use Magento e-commerce development, or those companies that focus more on lead generation.
Hoopla.io — Kansas City, Kan.
Hoopla.io wants to create just that around your events — a lot of hoopla. The company’s event mangement software helps you to promote and market your event online and, hopefully, without a lot of cost. You can create an event page, which Hoopla.io will then publish, share the event on all your social networks, and analyze what works and what doesn’t.
Nexus IT Group — Overland Park, Kan.
Nexus IT group is a little more traditional as far as startups come. The company is actually a staffing agency focused on IT candidates, but it seems Turnstone thinks working here is the real win.
Parking Panda — Baltimore, Md.
Parking Panda is one of those companies that is really trying to solve a pain point almost anyone in a big city understands: parking. The company’s app lets you reserve a parking spot in advance, so you don’t have to circle around the bloc ka few times. It’ll even help you save money on parking lots and garages. If you’re a person who owns a parking spot — let’s say, your driveway — you can rent out that space to others on the app.
Privy — Boston, Mass.

Futhermore, the company will give you analytics on your online performance, and let you create special lists of people to send emails and other messaging to.
SocialRadar — Washington, D.C.
SocialRadar wants to make social location far more than just a check in on Facebook or Foursquare. The company is building technologies that can do things like help you know exactly who’s around you at a party, or when you walk through a crowd. It’s building for the iPhone, Android, as well as Google Glass — which will likely be the real game changer as it can feed this information right to your eyeballs in real time.
Sparefoot — Austin, Texas

It lets you sift through locations, prices, unit sizes, and other amenities. You can book right on the site. If you’re a storage facility owner, you can sign up right on the site as well.
Sparkhouse — Costa Mesa, Calif.
Almost every company wants to have an in-house video editor to churn out those beautiful and inspiration videos that go viral overnight.

It will build commercials, “digital billboards,” and even help you with guerrilla marketing.
