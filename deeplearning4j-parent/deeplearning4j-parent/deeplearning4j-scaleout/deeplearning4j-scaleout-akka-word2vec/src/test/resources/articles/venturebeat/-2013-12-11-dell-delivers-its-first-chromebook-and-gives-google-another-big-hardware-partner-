Dude, you’re gettin’ a Dell (Chromebook).
Dell today announced the Chromebook 11 , the company’s first foray into Google’s take on laptops. Aimed at schools and students, the sub-$300 device features 16GB of internal storage, a 11.6-inch, 1366 x 768 display, and 1o hours of battery life.
It also has the exact same name as HP’s own Chromebook 11, which the company announced back in October .
While Dell has been testing Chrome OS in its computers since 2010 , the company’s first Chromebook is fairly late to market. Since Samsung introduced its first Chromebook in 2011, Lenovo , Acer , HP, and Google itself have all done the same. Dell, in that respect, is playing catch-up here.
Either way, Dell’s entry is hugely symbolic for Google, which now has the four biggest PC makers signed onto its Chromebook effort. Considering the tepid consumer response that’s greeted Windows 8 so far, the manufacturer enthusiasm for Chromebooks shouldn’t be the biggest surprise.
Th 4GB Dell Chromebook will be available next month, while the 2GB version is pegged for a “first quarter 2014″ release.
