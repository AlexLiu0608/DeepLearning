Still need to finish up your holiday shopping? Or maybe just buying a gift for yourself? Either way, it’s definitely been a good month to buy Apple products, with more discounts on iPhones and iPads than I can remember seeing in holiday’s past. And now you can add Target to the list, which is serving up some last-minute holiday savings.
Here’s a look at Target’s iPhone and iPad deals through December 24. Of course, those iPhone 5c and 5s prices will require you to sign a two-year contract.
Dec. 15 – 21
iPhone 5c, $50 plus a $50 Target gift card
iPhone 5s, $149.99
First-generation iPad mini, $299 plus a $30 Target gift card
Dec. 22 – 24
iPhone 5c, $30 plus a $30 Target gift card
iPhone 5s, $179.99 plus a $25 Target gift card
iPad Air, $479 plus a $20 Target gift card
First-generation iPad mini, $299 plus a $30 Target gift card
On top of these discounts, you can trade-in any working smartphone and get the value of your phone plus an additional $25 store credit toward the purchase of any contract phone through the month of December.
So far, I think the lowest iPhone prices I’ve seen are from Sam’s Club, which is offering the iPhone 5s for $119 through January. But you need to have a membership in order to shop there. For everyone else, this is a pretty good deal. But keep in mind that Apple sales abound this season, so it pays to shop around.
