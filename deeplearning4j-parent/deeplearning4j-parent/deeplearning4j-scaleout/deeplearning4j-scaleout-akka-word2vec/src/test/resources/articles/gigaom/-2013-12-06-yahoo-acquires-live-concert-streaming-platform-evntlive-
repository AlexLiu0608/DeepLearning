Summary:
Yahoo has snapped up the team behind concert live streaming platform Evntlive.
Redwood City-Calif. based live concert streaming platform Evntlive has been acquired by Yahoo. Evntlive announced the acquisition on its website Friday, stating that the service will be discontinued, and that the Evntlive team will join Yahoo Video. The announcement continued:
“When we started EVNTLIVE in early 2012, we set out to change the way that fans engage with live music online by creating an interactive, virtual venue. Since launching our beta service in April 2013, we have live streamed hundreds of performances from amazing artists and festivals to fans all over the world.”
Evntlive was co-founded by former Cisco CTO Judy Estrin, and offered viewers a more immersive live streaming experience of concerts by letting them access multiple camera angles as well as live chats and other interactive features. The company was part of a growing list of startups that is trying to reinvent live music events, with one of the new entrants being Turntable.fm.
Evntlive raised a total of $2.3 million in funding, with investors including Vint Cerf, Yogen Dalal, Dave House and others.
Yahoo has been on a bit of an acquisition spree under CEO Marissa Mayer, who has tried to get a stronger foothold in the video space, and previously tried to acquire French video platform DailyMotion, only to be rebuffed by French regulators.
