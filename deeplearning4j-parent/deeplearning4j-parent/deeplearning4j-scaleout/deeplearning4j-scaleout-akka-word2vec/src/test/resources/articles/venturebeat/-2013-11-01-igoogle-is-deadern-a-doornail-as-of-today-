As promised way back in July , Google is “retiring” iGoogle today.
I.e., they’re taking it out behind the shed and coming back with an empty shell and a heavy heart.
Google launched iGoogle in 2005 as a personalized web portal that included any kind of random crap your little head could dream up (i.e. “widgets”/”gadgets”). Your iGoogle page might contain your email, your instant messages, a little bit of Minesweeper, a little quote from literature — truly random ish.
iGoogle also had a few themes, much as Chrome does now.
But two years ago, as Google+ was being launched, Google announced that iGoogle’s social features would disappear as the company focused on its baby social network.
And there’s also Google Now to think about; this voice-activated personalized digital assistant is full of real-time, relevant data that integrates beautifully with the Android mobile experience. It’s the Batmobile to iGoogle’s Old Yeller.
Finally, in July, Google told us how it really felt, saying it would shutter iGoogle this year due to “the unforeseen evolution of web and mobile apps and the erosion of the need for the site.”
How cruel! How sad!
As of November 1, 2013, iGoogle now redirects to boring old “regular” Google.
By way of keeping y’all in the loop, Google claims its Google+ services now have 300 million active users, and Google Now has moved to the desktop and continues to get lovely upgrades regularly.
