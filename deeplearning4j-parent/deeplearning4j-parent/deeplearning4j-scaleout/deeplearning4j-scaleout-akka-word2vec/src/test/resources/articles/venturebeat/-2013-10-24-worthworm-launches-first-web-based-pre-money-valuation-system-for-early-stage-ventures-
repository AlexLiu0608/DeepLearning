Worthworm helps entrepreneurs and angel investors establish a       reasonable and defensible starting point for investment negotiations
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 24, 2013–
Worthworm ,       the most rigorous, web-based valuation system for entrepreneurs and       angel investors, today announced its public availability. Designed to       answer the demand for an easy-to-use, web-based system that will       generate a realistic, defensible and credible pre-money valuation (PMV)       for early stage ventures seeking investment from angel investors,       Worthworm is the only tool of its kind to facilitate negotiations       between entrepreneurs and investors based upon a pre-money valuation in       which both parties can have a high degree of confidence.
“The reality is that there has not been a reliable, simple, or       cost-effective way to calculate an early stage company’s valuation –       which is why so many entrepreneurs and angel investors get it wrong,”       said Alan Lobock, co-founder of Worthworm. “The alternatives to       Worthworm are spending hours upon hours customizing a spreadsheet that a       seasoned investor is unlikely to accept as credible if for no other       reason than the valuation method applied, or spending thousands of       dollars with a valuation firm. When you are clocking 80-hour weeks       building your start-up from the ground-up on limited funds, neither of       those options are attractive. Worthworm is designed to fill the market       void, providing users with an affordable, rigorous, web-based valuation       system that derives a reasonable and defensible pre-money valuation from       which entrepreneurs and angel investors can begin negotiating.”
Worthworm applies to a user’s data a blend of the valuation       methodologies widely accepted by seasoned angel investors, third-party       valuation comparables and proprietary real-options technologies to go       beyond providing just a reliable PMV. Instead, armed with data from the       system, Worthworm users will also gain a deeper understanding of what       risks can be mitigated and what opportunities can be exploited to       rapidly increase a venture’s value for the benefit of its owners. In       order to help entrepreneurs create the most comprehensive valuation and       for angel investors to standardize a portion of their due diligence       process either in the screening phase or later, the Worthworm system       includes:
Guided Questionnaire – The first step in Worthworm’s valuation         process requires users to answer more than 70 questions focused on the         key valuation drivers of an early stage company. Entrepreneurs are         compelled to think like investors to complete certain sections of the         questionnaire, which will better prepare them for pitches and meetings         with prospective investors.
PMV Report – With nearly 1,100 analytic parameters and more         than 4,000 outputs, Worthworm delivers a PMV Report for each completed         questionnaire. The report provides a summary description of the         venture, its PMV placed upon a valuation bar that estimates how much         higher or lower the PMV could be based on market risks, graphs         illustrating where the venture places with respect to key valuation         drivers, and all of the questions and their answers to ensure full         transparency between entrepreneurs and investors.
Interactive Tools – After calculating a PMV, users also have         access to a suite of additional tools that help entrepreneurs and         angel investors maximize the venture’s PMV. These include the Risks         Tool, which identifies in the form of a tornado diagram areas of         uncertainty within the venture that could be mitigated to increase the         company’s PMV; the Risks and Opportunities Tool, which         highlights areas of opportunity in which the venture could invest to         increase its PMV and compares these available increases to those to be         gained by mitigating uncertainties, and The Next Steps Tool,         which analyzes the key valuation drivers in a way that allows the user         to develop strategies and tactics to maximize the venture’s PMV.
Reports – Worthworm generates a number of comprehensive reports         that can be quickly and easily downloaded and shared with stakeholders         or investors. The reports highlight such key information as the         venture’s projected capitalization table, equity dilution, and         potential return on investment. Users can also invite prospective         investors and/or stakeholders to their Worthworm account, where they         may engage in what-if analyses or model the venture differently to         derive a scenario on which all parties may agree for purposes of         proceeding with an investment or implementing selected strategies and         tactics.
Worthworm was also designed with angel investors in mind. Given the       recent lift of the General Solicitation ban, the number of U.S.       investors considering early stage venture funding is expected to rise.
“Worthworm is one of the strongest tools in an investor’s arsenal,       providing them with a consistent framework with which to standardize the       screening process or later due diligence,” Alan said. “If you are an       angel investor and a venture is seeking capital from you, insist on       getting its Worthworm report. And if you make an investment, insist that       the venture update its Worthworm report throughout the year so you can       track its performance with respect to key valuation drivers and evaluate       its strategies based upon the venture’s changing risk and opportunity       profile.”
As part of a lengthy beta process, dozens of angel investors and       directors of top-ranked entrepreneurship programs at universities across       the country have seen Worthworm’s capabilities.
“Worthworm is a tool every entrepreneur should be using to prepare for       meetings with potential investors,” said Ken Jones, Director of       Undergraduate Programs at The University of Houston’s Wolff Center for       Entrepreneurship (ranked the number two undergraduate entrepreneurship       program in the nation by the Princeton Review.) “I have the       responsibility to identify tools for our students that not only       contribute to their education in entrepreneurship, but will serve them       well when they graduate from our program. Worthworm is exactly that.       Through its use, student-entrepreneurs get to see their ventures through       an investor’s eyes, gaining an understanding of the varied issues that       raise or lower a venture’s value. Upon graduation, these same students       will be able to confidently pursue funding for their ventures armed with       credible and defensible pre-money valuations and related analyses that       any investor would find insightful and reliable.”
