Watch for Microsoft’s April Build conference where it’s expected to detail the newest Windows Phone features. According to The Verge , those will include at least two key functions: The debut of a personal assistant app and a centralized notification center for Windows Phones. While iOS has Siri and Android has Google Now, Microsoft’s virtual assistant is rumored to be codenamed Cortana, after the AI assistant in the Halo game series for Xbox. Unlike the other main platforms, Windows Phone currently handles notifications on an app level without any central notification center to manage such messages. Perhaps Cortana will do that for us too?
