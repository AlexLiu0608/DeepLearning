Getting hired seems to be a global commodity, as job and HR information portal Glassdoor has announced a $50 million Series E funding round, led by Tiger Global Management. Glassdoor indicated that the new funds will go directly towards an international expansion of the company’s offerings, with plans to hire 100 people around the world within the next year.
“We became a global company almost overnight and this new capital will allow us to step on the gas and provide a richer product and platform internationally,” said Robert Hohman, Glassdoor’s co-founder in CEO, in an email to Gigaom.
This latest funding round — which also saw participation from existing investors Benchmark, Sutter Hill Ventures, Battery Ventures and DAGVentures — doubles the company’s overall fundraising dollars since it began in 2007. While Glassdoor is best known for its anonymous reviews and salary reports, it has become increasingly involved in the talent recruiting and job networking market. According to its data, more than 1,400 companies currently subscribe to Glassdoor to boost their recruiting initiatives with everything from advanced company profiles to display advertising.
The decision to take job listings global also has a lot of supporting evidence in Glassdoor’s own data. The company has grown to accommodate international data since it was founded in 2007, and now offers insights into companies across 190 countries. And the company said that right now, one in four users are coming to the site from outside the U.S., although it’s unclear if those users are looking for international or American jobs. In addition to a strong international base, the company has seen gains in mobile — 35 percent of traffic to the website comes from mobile.
