Summary:
If you had doubts that you’ll be able to speak to a computer and have Google Now bring up personalized information, Google’s newest Chrome extension should dispel them.
Google is one step closer to bringing Google Now to computers thanks to a new voice search extension for its Chrome browser. The new Google Search Voice Hotword extension adds a simple but key feature to Chrome: Install it and you can say “OK Google” when on Google’s search page. Instead of having to tap a microphone button in the search bar — which you can still do — you can now speak your queries  without a tap.
This feature is akin to what Google implemented in the latest versions of Android. In Android 4.4, you can speak the “OK Google” hotword  and perform a Google query, for example. Similar to this Chrome extension, there is a limitation: You have to be on a home screen to make the magic happen. The Moto X has no such limitation as it is always listening for the hotword . The “OK Google” voice query is also present in the developer version of Google’s Chrome OS although you have to flip a switch to enable it .
While Google is positioning this as a search command, it’s already more powerful than that.
For example, after installing the new extension in Chrome on my Mac, I checked on my favorite NHL team by saying “OK Google, did the Devils win?” Instead of a standard search result, Chrome opened up a Google Now-like result of the Devils’ most recent game and then spoke this aloud: “No, the Devils lost to the Jets 3 to 1. They are playing the Hurricanes today at 7 pm.”
I was also able to get Google to recite my next scheduled appointment, the local weather and the time of the next Liverpool FC match though this method.
It doesn’t take a genius to see where Google is going here. It is unifying and improving the search experience between all of its products — Google Glass, Chrome, Chrome OS, and Android — by using Google Now powered by voice as the glue. Call it intelligent search or a personal search assistant if you like. And don’t think this might be limited to traditional computing devices either. I can envision many connected objects that include a microphone so that Google voice search is the main interface. A connected car is a perfect example.
We’re not at that point yet, of course, but it seems to me like we’re heading down that road. And as a heavy user of Google voice search services, I’m enjoying the ride.
