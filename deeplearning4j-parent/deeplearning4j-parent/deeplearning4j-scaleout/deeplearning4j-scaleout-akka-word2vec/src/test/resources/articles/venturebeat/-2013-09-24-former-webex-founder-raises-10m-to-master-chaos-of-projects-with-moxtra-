Subrah Iyar sold WebEx to Cisco for a whopping $3.2 billion in 2007 .
Had it been me, I would still be on tropical island somewhere downing piña coladas, but Iyar decided to build another company focused on online collaboration.
Today, Iyar’s current project,  Moxtra , announced that it has closed $10 million in the first round of funding for its mobile content collaboration platform.
The product focuses on the concept of “shared binders.” Using these binders, you can collect and organize any type of digital content, personalize it, and share and collaborate. Moxtra syncs it across multiple devices and extends the capability of other applications, like Evernote and DropBox.
Iyar said the goal is to “master the chaos of project management and team collaboration.”
Moxtra also launched the second version of the platform today, with new features for chatting, a timeline, real-time updates, text and voice bubbles, desktop sharing, and iOS 7.
Online productivity and project management is a crowded space right now. There is a lot of stuff on the Web, and people need ways to organize it, for professional and personal purposes. Once organized, people need tools for sharing and searching, and everything has to happen on multiple devices.
Moxtra joins the ranks of web clippers, such as Evernote, Pinterest, and Springpad, as well as project management solutions like Asana and Basecamp.
It stands out from these competitors by implementing features from all of them and emphasizing the importance of context through its communication tools. Furthermore, it is mobile-first, which is key in a world where work and communication are increasingly conducted from mobile devices.
The Moxtra app is the company’s first product. Cisco and KDDI led this investment, with participation from Starwood Capital’s Barry Strenlicht. It will go towards platform development and marketing efforts.
Moxtra is based in Cupertino, Calif.
