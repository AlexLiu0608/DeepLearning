When someone clicks on a link to your website, forget sending them to your homepage. You want to send them to a page that captures their information and turns them into customers.
In other words, you want a landing page.
The Minneapolis-based LeadPages strives to offer you the best landing page with the highest conversion rate possible. It scored $5 million in Series A funding in a round led by Foundry Group with Arthur Ventures. The company says it will use the capital to develop its product and expand its team.
Founded less than a year ago, LeadPages offers a library of mobile responsive HTML 5 landing pages. Equipped with built-in analytics, the pages are geared toward a variety of customer interactions, such as signing up for a webinar, downloading a white paper, or capturing lead information.
So you can track how your landing pages are performing, the service also integrates with third-party analytics and split testing tools such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel, KISSmetrics, and more. A dashboard gives you a quick view of conversion rates, opt-in rates, and unique views for existing pages.
The landing pages integrate with a variety of popular e-mail services and CRM systems. Pages can be self-hosted or published to WordPress or Facebook. LeadPages also offers to host and deploy landing pages at no additional cost.
So far, business is good, says LeadPages. The company claims it had more than 6,000 customers and hundreds of advanced sales before it even officially launched a product.
The cost of for the LeadPages service is $37 a month for the basic service and $67 a month for the pro version. Discounts apply to annual subscriptions.
