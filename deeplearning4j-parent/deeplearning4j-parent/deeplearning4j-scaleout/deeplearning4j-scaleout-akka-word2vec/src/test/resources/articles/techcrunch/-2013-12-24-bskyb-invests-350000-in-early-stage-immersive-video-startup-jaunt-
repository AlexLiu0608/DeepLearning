Healint Wants To Make Life Better For Stroke Patients
British Sky Broadcasting Group (called BSkyB) has made a $350,000 investment in Jaunt , an early-stage startup that captures and displays 360 degree video content. BSkyB said that the new partnership will give it “additional insight into developments within the field.”
Though Palo Alto-based Jaunt’s placeholder site currently offers no information besides “stayed tune,” the company has been  building its engineering team . Its current team already has an impressive pedigree and includes CEO Jens Christensen , who also launched Ellerdale (acquired by Flipboard in 2010) ; CTO Arthur van Hoff, who previously held the same position at Flipboard ; and VP of engineering Tom Annau , whose resume includes a stint as a senior software engineering manager at Google.
Jaunt’s LinkedIn profile says its technology “combines computational photography, statistical algorithms, massively parallel processing, cutting-edge hardware and virtual reality.”
For Sky, Jaunt fits in with a series of investments it has made in video-related startups.
For example, back in May 2013, it invested $1.9 million in TV streaming platform Roku , one year after joining several other investors, including News Corporation, Menlo Ventures and Globespan Capital Partners, in a $45 million round .
