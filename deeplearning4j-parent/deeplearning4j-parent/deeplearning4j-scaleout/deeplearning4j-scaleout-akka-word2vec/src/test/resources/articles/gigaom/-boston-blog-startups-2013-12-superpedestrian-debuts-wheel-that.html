Assaf Biderman, founder of Cambridge-based startup Superpedestrian , discovered that in order to increase bicycle ridership, he had to literally reinvent the wheel.
With help from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's SENSEable CIty Lab, Biderman designed a wheel that snaps onto the back wheel of almost any bike — road, mountain or cruiser — to transform it into a more powerful, electric-hybrid bicycle.
The technology, dubbed the Copenhagen Wheel, will retail online at superpedestrian.com for $699 starting Tuesday.
"It makes it possible to bike almost anywhere, and you don't really have to think twice," Biderman said in an interview.
The idea for the Copenhagen Wheel was born about three years ago, out of MIT's SENSEable City Lab, a research initiative aimed at studying changes in technology and the built environment.
Partnering with the mayor of Copenhagen, Denmark — one of the most cycling-heavy cities in the world — Biderman, associate director of the SENSEable City Lab, set out to answer a question: How can we get people to cycle even more?
"There seems to be a biking renaissance," Biderman said. "People are eager to get on their bicycles. But we're stuck with cities that are built for cars."
Biderman and his team discovered that steep-incline hills and long distances are the most typical inhibitors for cyclists who want to commute to the city from the suburbs, or riders who want to substitute bicycles for cars.
With the Copenhagen Wheel, there will be fewer barriers to bicycling; hills will disappear and distances will shrink, he said.
"It's also something fun and beautiful," he said. "It connects you with the street and the city in a new way."
