Advertisers using Twitter to connect with potential customers can now target with even more fine-grained accuracy, thanks to three new updates that Twitter announced today.
“Now all advertisers can segment audiences on iOS and Android by operating system version, specific device, and WiFi connectivity,” Twitter ads product manager Kelton Lynn posted this morning. “And we’re also introducing granular reporting analytics for these targeting types across all campaigns.”
You can already target Twitter ads by geography , by keyword , by sites people have visited recently , and more. But in terms of device factors, all Twitter provided was iOS, Android, Windows Phone, or whatever other operating system they might be using.
(76 percent of people access twitter on a mobile device.)
Now you can target iPhone 5S users to ensure you get an audience of wealthy early adopters. Or Nokia Lumia 1020 users to get a group of mobile photography lovers. Or Nexus Android users to get Android aficionados who love a pure Android experience straight from Google. And, as Lynn noted, telcos can cherry-pick who they want to sent upgrade offers to, based on the device type a potential customer is currently using.
“All marketers can focus their campaigns on users with device models that are indicative of demographics which align with their campaign goals,” as Lynn puts it.
Twitter advertisers will also get improved insight with a new segmentation report that surfaces the new data, showing in detail who is seeing and interacting with your tweets.
The new capabilities are available today on Twitter.com, and will be available “soon” through Ads API partners.
