Our nerd party just keeps getting nerdier, kids.
DevBeat, our first-ever developer conference, will now feature a special chat with PHP creator Rasmus Lerdorf. What makes his chat so special? Read on, friends.
DevBeat  is coming up on Nov. 12 and Nov. 13 in San Francisco. Tickets are selling like hotcakes  thanks to the crazy lineup of speakers we’re booking. But this show isn’t just presentations from heavy-hitters like Lerdorf. We’ve also got programming master classes, workshops, technical talks, and career development interviews going on — everything you need to take your job, skills, and life to the next level.
But back to today’s big speaker announcement. Lerdorf is known for having gotten the PHP project off the ground in 1995 and has contributed to a number of other open-source efforts over the years. He was an infrastructure architect at Yahoo for more than seven years and joined Etsy in 2012. He was born in Greenland, grew up in Denmark and Canada, and has a systems design engineering degree from the University of Waterloo. You can follow @rasmus on Twitter.
For DevBeat, he’ll be doing a Live AMA (Ask Me Anything) thread — so start workshopping your PHP/open source questions now. Lerdorf can choose to answer or take a pass for any question, so make ‘em good!
Stay tuned for more DevBeat program and speaker announcements over the coming weeks, and  make sure to register today!  The room is filling up quickly with hackers of all kinds, so get your friends/coworkers/arch-nemeses together and get tickets while the gettin’s good.
