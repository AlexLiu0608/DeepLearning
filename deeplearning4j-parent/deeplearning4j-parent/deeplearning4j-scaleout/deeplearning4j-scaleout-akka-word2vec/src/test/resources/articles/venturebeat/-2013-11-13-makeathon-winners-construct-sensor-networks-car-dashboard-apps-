Glassboard
If you’ve got a recent-model car, you can keep tabs on where it’s going by checking the GPS records. But the makers of Glassboard want to go one step further and give you the ability to keep an eye on your car’s whereabouts — and its dashboard data — in real time. That could be incredibly useful for companies that manage fleets of cars, as well as for anxious parents. Their demo showed a real-time display of the car’s speed, engine RPM, temperature, fuel capacity, and odometer reading. Glassboard won a TDK test unit from Ford (a $5,000 value) and the chance to compete for a spot in Ford’s upcoming CES booth in January.
Real-Time Taxi
Real-Time Taxi looks simple on the face of it: It’s a notification system that taxi companies might use to send alerts to taxi drivers about people who have requested rides. Using Ford’s AppLink technology, the app (running on a phone plugged into the dashboard of the car) sends a notification to the car’s dashboard: “Customer waiting for pickup at Van Ness and Sutter,” for example. The driver can accept the ride or reject it using steering-wheel buttons. It’s easy to imagine something like this integrated into a taxi app — or becoming a taxi app of its own. The maker of this app, Geremy Cohen, used PubNub (his employer) to manage the distribution of data from customers to taxi drivers. Like Glassboard, this app won a Ford TDK and the chance to win a spot in Ford’s CES lineup. (Ford initially planned to give away just one TDK, but they were so impressed by the two car-oriented hacks that they ponied up a second one.)
Drinks on Us
Sometimes the coolest hardware hacks are purely hardware. While the other winning competitors in our Makeathon used code to leverage their hardware, Drinks on Us went purely electronic, building a water bottle sensor that detects how full your bottle is and signals you accordingly (low beeps for a fairly full bottle, or high-pitched chirps when it’s nearly empty). That could be useful for drinking games — hey, your friend just took a swig, maybe you should too — or for encouraging people to drink more water. It uses a Sumobot board, LEDs, infrared sensors, and more. Drinks on Us won a 3-month TechShop membership.
