Hi Manish, don't be worried! oDesk and Elance will continue to operate as separate platforms, so your profile, ratings and reputation will remain unchanged. The oDesk you know and love isn't going anywhere -- in fact, we expect that your oDesk experience will only improve, because we'll have the combined resources and innovations that result from the merger. oDesk CEO Gary Swart recently addressed many of these concerns in his latest blog post here, take a look! https://www.odesk.com/blog/2013/12/hear-letter-freelancers-yesterdays-news/

ofcourse not. atleast 1 profile should be visible they are ready to show their achievement. So they will not private it may be few are. I don't believe you earn that type of money. I check in lot of profile yes 100k $-300k earner available. There are some creative artist or group of team who work for 3d animation. their work capability like a hollywood film vfx etc. still I don't see anyone who have earning more than $2000k. So definitely not and never suspend their account. I was wrong to forget another 0.

Yep Stupidity.. Elance is the same level as freelancer, hehe I seen on hackernews someone commented its like altavista buying google,lol exactly right.. elance and freelancer are full of scammers and even their management seems like scammers, they charge freelancers a membership fee lol, well good luck! I hire people on oDesk and it seems ok.. you can not beat the fundamentals of scammers you just need to cover your back but it seems like for some reason scammers gravitate to elance and freelancer.com, for some reason they love it! hehe. well oDesk is usable, I can post jobs and get my jobs done, its enough for me.. dont change

really? you may surprise if I like to show you something. may be going to crazy to earn money from elance. you kno why. some one earn more than 300k in elance? did you believe it? Lets show me one example user earn more than 200k $ in odesk. I check thousand of people profile don't even seen like that one. So its its not quality they never earn like that.

I think I know why you can't see the users earn more than 200k on odesk. many times, odesk support team suspends the users without any information to them. I've seen many freelancers who had been suspended without having any information and most of them are complaining about their suspension policy. I hired more than 10 developers - providing good quality works and having brilliant profile(worked more than 5k ~ 10k hours) and most of them are suspended this year. It makes many difficulties for freelances to work on odesk.

@rarcntv - some profiles are private - like mine for example. I don't need someone looking at how much I earn, it's not something I want to advertise. And this is mainly because If someone has seen that I earn a certain amount may think I am to expensive or to cheap.

I don't see any one work with 5k -10k hourly rate. I believe you must be wrong. Even a hollywood artist never get that type of hour. definitely they are scam. thats why odesk suspend them. and if you hire them you may be you or don't know exact hourly rate.

I hired the developers with $25~40 hourly rate. What I'm meaning is they are worked on odesk more than 5,000~10,000 hours.

Yes , you are right. I don't know what happened with ODesk. One of my freelancer has 4.4 score, but his account was suspended. This doesn't make sense to me. I think thats a really bad idea to merge elance with Odesk. Odesk will make things worst for Elance too.
I left the Odesk because of all this fuss, because once you feel comfortable working at ODesk then suddenly your account got suspended. Weird and disgusting.

Trust me , you don't get suspended if you are innocent. The freelancer did something to get his account suspended. I have my account on oDesk since 2007 and started working on it on 2009 and until today I had no problems. But I respected the rules. So if you tell me out of thin air he/she got his/hers account suspended it sounds fishy to me.

Hi AAAJ, thanks for your feedback. Rest assured that oDesk and Elance will remain as separate platforms, and the merger will only improve our ability to make oDesk a great experience!

I hope direct bank transfer feature of oDesk isn't removed due to this merger. Elance withdrawals are pretty expensive. This feature of oDesk was one of the main reason that Freelancers chose oDesk over Elance!
