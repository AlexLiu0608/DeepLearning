Startup accelerator 500 Startups announced the list of companies that made the cut for its seventh batch today, which includes quite a few firsts for 500, such as its first biotech investment as well as an investment in an electric skateboard company.
500 Startups is an early-stage seed fund and incubator program that’s become a brand name over the last few years, mostly through the sheer volume of companies it’s invested in. The Mountain View, Calif.-based group invests between $25,000 to $250,000 in startups, primarily those aimed at consumers and small to medium-size businesses as well as related web infrastructure services. It recently just closed a new $44.1 million second fund and filed documents with the SEC for a brand new $100 million third fund .
But back to the latest batch of companies: There were 30 total that hail from all over the world, including Sweden, U.K., Italy, Mexico, China, Taiwan, Thailand, Australia, India, and Brazil. The list also pulls companies in from around the country rather than grabbing only companies from the San Francisco area. There are also five teams with women founders and 12 teams featuring founders from outside the country.
And in addition to the new companies, which we’ve listed descriptions of below along with the group’s signature music video , 500 Startups also announced that it’s opening up the application process for its next batch of companies via AngelList .
