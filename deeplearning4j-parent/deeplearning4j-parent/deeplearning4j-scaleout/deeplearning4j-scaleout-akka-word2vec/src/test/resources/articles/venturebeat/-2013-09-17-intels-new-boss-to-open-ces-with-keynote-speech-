Intel’s new chief executive Brian Krzanich will be the opening keynote speaker at the 2014 International CES , previously known as the Consumer Electronics Show.
Krzanich, who was appointed to the top post at Intel in May, may very well have some interesting news to deliver by the time CES rolls around in January. Intel has been rumored to be working on a set-top box and it just unveiled a series of new chips that will be used tablets that are under $100 and laptops under $300.
The CES trade show will run from Jan. 7 to Jan. 10 in Las Vegas. Krzanich will give his keynote speech on Monday, Jan. 6, at the Venetian Hotel.
“For decades, Intel’s innovative technologies have been at the heart of connecting people around the world and bringing information into the hands of consumers,” said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO, Consumer Electronics Association, in a statement. “Under Brian Krzanich’s leadership, Intel is defining a new era in which every device and every object connects and computes. We look forward to hearing his vision for future innovation at the 2014 International CES.”
Krzanich’s address will be part of the new Tech Titans Keynote series at the 2014 CES. CES is expected to draw more than 3,200 exhibitors to Las Vegas across 15 tech product categories.
