O’Reilly Radar has a useful post from Jetpac CTO Pete Warden on how his company, which offers a visual guide to popular places, uses Amazon EC2, Hadoop and an open source computer-vision program called OpenCV to analyze Instagram images. It’s amazing how pervasive cloud computing and big data technologies have become, and how fast they’ve evolved consumers’ expectations of what an application should be. The bad news is developers need to get smart on how to process lots of data,. The good news is the tools to do it are getting less expensive by the day.
