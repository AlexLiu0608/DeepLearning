Zofari Debuts A “Pandora For Places” On iPhone & Android
Well, that’s a wrap. For those who don’t know, we’ve been running a startup event in Moscow for 4 solid years, TechCrunch Moscow . Our partners, Digital October and Kite Ventures have been absolutely awesome, so a huge thanks to them. Just go check out the amazing pictures and the archived video from today. But, after two days of deliberation and 38 startup pitches , there can be only one winner. And that is DreamRoomer .
DreamRoomer turns the apartment rental marketplace model on it’s head. It allows landlords to find the ideal tenants, rather than tenants to find landlords. To rent out an apartment you own you register on the site upload photos of the apartment and invite tenants to check it out. When a potential tenant agrees, landlord and tenant are connected, independent of any realtor.
But there was a runner up, and that was MeDesk , a cloud healthcare platform that captures and securely stores patient medical data from any source or provider in order to integrate healthcare delivery. Aimed initially at the Russian-speaking healthcare market, this is a fully featured ecosystem for the private healthcare market that facilitates the collaboration of all the major players – clinics, patients, CROs, employers, insurance companies, and medical device vendors. Already the platform is serving over 100,000 patients across Russia.
