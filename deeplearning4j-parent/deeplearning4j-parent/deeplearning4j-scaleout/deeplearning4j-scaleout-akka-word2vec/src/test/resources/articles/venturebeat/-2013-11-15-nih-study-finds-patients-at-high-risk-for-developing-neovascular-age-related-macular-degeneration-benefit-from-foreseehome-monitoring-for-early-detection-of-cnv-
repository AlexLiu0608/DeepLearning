Report Represents the Most Comprehensive Study of Home Monitoring for       Progression of AMD
ST. LOUIS–(BUSINESS WIRE)–November 16, 2013–
The results of the Home Monitoring of the Eye (HOME) study,       conducted in Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) clinical centers,       executed by the EMMES Corporation and sponsored by Notal Vision Ltd. Tel Aviv, Israel, have been accepted for publication in Ophthalmology.       The results show that participants at high risk for developing choroidal       neovascularization (CNV), the neovascular or wet phase of age-related       macular degeneration (AMD), using the ForeseeHome monitoring device       strategy had significantly better preservation of their visual acuity at       the time of CNV detection than the control group of participants who       were only using standard care methods to self monitor their AMD for       progression. The study’s Data Safety and Monitoring Committee       recommended early termination of the study on April 2, 2013 based on       superior vision outcomes among the participants randomly assigned to use       the home device.
The AREDS2 HOME Study was a collaborative effort led by the National Eye       Institute to evaluate the performance of a home monitoring device plus       standard care compared to standard care monitoring alone for the       detection of AMD progression to the neovascular phase. Standard care       methods may include periodic monocular self checks of vision clarity,       blind spots and distortion, which may include use of an Amsler grid. As       treatments to manage the neovascular phase of AMD have improved, the       importance of early detection of this event has increased in an effort       to optimize outcomes following treatment of neovascular AMD.       Approximately 8 million individuals in the United States, age 50 and       older, are estimated to have intermediate (large drusen) or advanced AMD       in one eye, placing them at high risk of progression to AMD, ranging       from 25 to 50% over a five-year period.
Results of the HOME Study and Implications for AMD Management
At the time of CNV detection, 87% of eyes in the ForeseeHome device arm       maintained visual acuity of 20/40 or better compared to 62% in the       standard care alone arm. Median acuity among device users at the time of       CNV diagnosis was 20/32. Among participants who used the device at the       recommended minimum frequency (twice per week) to monitor their AMD for       progression, 94% of eyes that progressed to CNV maintained 20/40 or       better visual acuity. When CNV was detected, participants in the       ForeseeHome device arm lost fewer letters on visual acuity testing       (median loss of 4 letters) from entry levels of vision at the start of       the study compared to those in the standard care alone arm (median loss       of 9 letters). Use of the ForeseeHome device resulted in an increase in       the proportion of CNV events first identified at home, meaning in       between routine ophthalmic office visits to assess detection of disease       progression. Among individuals using standard care methods for       monitoring, only 55% of those that progressed noted symptoms at home       that led them to present for examination; whereas 80% of the       participants in the device monitoring group returned sooner than a       scheduled visit because a change was noted by the device or by       self-monitoring. This was associated with a greater degree of vision       preservation at CNV diagnosis among individuals who returned promptly       for changes, as the median visual acuity loss at CNV detection was 3.0       letters for those in the device arm compared with 11.5 letters for those       in the standard care group. The average annual rate of false alerts       among the device users, reported as the annual false positive rate, was       0.24 alerts/year, which may be extrapolated to one false alert on       average every 4.2 years for each ForeseeHome user.
“Persons 60 years of age or older should undergo dilated eye       examinations to determine their risk of developing advanced AMD,       especially CNV,” said Jeffrey S. Heier, M.D., Director of the       Vitreoretinal Service and the Director of Retina Research at Ophthalmic       Consultants of Boston and one of the principal investigators of the HOME       Study. “In contrast to current home monitoring strategies, those with       intermediate AMD (bilateral large drusen) or advanced AMD in 1 eye are       likely to benefit from home monitoring with the ForeseeHome device to       detect the development of CNV at an earlier stage with better       preservation of their visual acuity to maximize visual acuity results       after intravitreal therapy with anti-VEGF agents.”
About the HOME Study
The HOME Study was a controlled, randomized clinical trial that was part       of AREDS2. The study was conducted in 44 clinical centers across the       U.S., enrolling 1,520 participants at high risk for developing CNV. The       objective of the HOME Study was to determine whether monitoring with the       ForeseeHome device plus standard care results in earlier detection of       CNV compared to standard care alone. Standard care included instructions       to the patient on self-monitoring for CNV. Better visual acuity at the       time of CNV detection is both a reflection of earlier CNV detection as       well as a favorable predictor for visual function outcomes following the       management of CNV with intraocular anti-angiogenic medications.
About ForeseeHome™ AMD Monitoring Program
The ForeseeHome AMD Monitoring Program is a prescription-based,       comprehensive telemonitoring and data management system that extends the       management of AMD to patients’ homes between office visits. The test       results are transmitted to a central monitoring center that will alert,       physicians to immediate, significant visual field changes in their       patients, so that patients can be recalled for timely follow-up and       necessary treatment may be initiated. The ForeseeHome AMD Monitoring       Program utilizes a simple to use device based on preferential       hyperacuity perimetry, a form of visual-field testing, to identify       minute visual distortions, or metamorphopsia, for the detection of early       CNV development.
About Notal Vision™
Notal Vision was founded by two ophthalmologists, and is committed to       providing retina specialists with innovative, home-based, technology       solutions that support visual health in patients with AMD. The company’s       ForeseeHome® device is the first FDA-cleared home tele-monitoring device       that detects and characterizes visual distortion in AMD patients as an       aid to monitoring progression to CNV.
