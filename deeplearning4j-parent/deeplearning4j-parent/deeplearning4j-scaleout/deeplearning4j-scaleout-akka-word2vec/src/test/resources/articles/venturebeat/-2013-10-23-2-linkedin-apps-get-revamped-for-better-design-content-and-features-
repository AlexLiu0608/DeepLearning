SAN FRANCISCO — At a company “mobile day,” LinkedIn revealed a few additions to its mobile suite.
CEO Jeff Weiner told the audience of press that he fully expects  50 percent of traffic to be from mobile by next year; these new apps and features are how LinkedIn will accomplish that goal.
LinkedIn’s mobile product VP Joff Redfern first reviewed the whole suite of LinkedIn mobile apps: The LinkedIn “flagship” app, the publishing-focused Pulse (a recent acquisition ), the standalone Contacts app for heavy-duty businessfolks, and a mobile app version of its Recruiter experience.
Then, there’s the iPad app. It started out pretty dang sexy back in 2012, and it’s apparently just getting sexier with the years, like a digital Harrison Ford.
LinkedIn execs said today that the newest version of LinkedIn for iPad is more personalized, better designed, and easier to use. It will be available later today in the iTunes App Store.
Also coming soon is a refreshed version of Pulse, which gives LinkedIn’s news content a beautiful interface and hyper-relevant organization.
Next up, the company’s announcing a “new thing,” so stay tuned!
