Just a few months into his new job at VMware , former SAP executive Sanjay Poonen has orchestrated his first acquisition.
Poonen joined VMware in August to run the company’s end-user business and make strategic acquisitions. He immediately identified  Desktone , a desktop-as-a-service startup (or DaaS), as a contender for an acquisition.
Desktop as a service involves the outsourcing of a virtual desktop infrastructure to a third-party provider. The provider is responsible for managing the data storage, backup, security, and upgrades.

“Desktone has been running DaaS at scale for many years and has a strong reputation in helping service providers go to market quickly,” Poonen wrote in a blog post . Desktone’s platforms are currently integrated with VMware’s vCloud, vSphere and Horizon View products.
Poonen announced the acquisition today in a press release  and e-mail to the press.
VMware has not disclosed any of the financials, including the final sum for the acquisition. According to a news release, the transaction is expected to be immaterial to VMware’s financial results.
