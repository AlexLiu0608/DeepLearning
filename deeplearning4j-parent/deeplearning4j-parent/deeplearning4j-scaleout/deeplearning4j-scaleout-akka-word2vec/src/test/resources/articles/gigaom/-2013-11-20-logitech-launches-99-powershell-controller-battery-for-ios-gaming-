Summary:
It’s game on for iOS 7 hardware controllers: Logitech launched its entry with the PowerShell + Battery controller for $99. The accessory has an internal battery so it can recharge your iOS 7 device, but it lacks joystick controls, opting for a D-Pad instead.
This must be the week to debut gaming controllers for iPhones and iPod touch devices. Yesterday, Moga announced pre-orders for its Mogo Ace Power device and on Wednesday, Logitech counter-punched by launching its PowerShell Controller + Battery . Logitech’s accessory for iPhone 5, 5s and fifth-generation iPod touch is now available online for $99 at Best Buy and the Apple Online Store.
As the name implies, the PowerShell Controller + Battery includes an internal battery to keep your iOS 7 running after a long gaming session. The battery capacity is 1500 mAh and roughly doubles the run-time of your mobile device. To use the controller and charge your handheld, you simply insert it into the Logitech PowerShell Controller + Battery as you would any case.
Gaming controls adorn the left and right side of your iPhone or iPod touch: There’s a D-pad, shoulder triggers and action buttons for gaming. Since the controller doesn’t fold up — the competing Moga unit does — this won’t fit in a pocket. But on the other hand, it does recharge your iPhone or iPod touch, which to me makes it a better value for the same price. On the flipside, however, there are no analog sticks which could be a big let-down to serious gamers.
I’ll look to get my hands on one of these in the coming days and report back on the controls and game experience.
