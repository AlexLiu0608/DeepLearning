However, some of the singer’s less enthusiastic followers had a more sarcastic tone, with one tweeting: “How can Justin Bieber retire? He’s not even old enough to drink.”
Another tweeted, “Justin Bieber is going to retire, there is a Santa!”
Bieber also talked about retirement earlier this month during an interview on a Los Angeles radio station.
But his manager Scooter Braun was quoted by the British television network ITN as saying Bieber was kidding and is only going to take a break next year.
Bieber has had a run of negative media in the past year, including apologizing for a video in which he is seen urinating into a bucket, cursing Bill Clinton and spraying a photo of the former American president with cleaning fluid in a New York City restaurant kitchen.
In March, the singer scuffled with a photographer outside a London hotel during a European tour. Later that month, police were called to his Los Angeles area home after a neighbour claimed he had been threatened and struck by Bieber.
In June, Bieber struck a photographer with his Ferrari sports car while driving away from a comedy club in Los Angeles, though police said the accident was not considered a hit-and-run.
The movie, which takes the name of Bieber’s third studio album, could help repair his image after the difficult year.
