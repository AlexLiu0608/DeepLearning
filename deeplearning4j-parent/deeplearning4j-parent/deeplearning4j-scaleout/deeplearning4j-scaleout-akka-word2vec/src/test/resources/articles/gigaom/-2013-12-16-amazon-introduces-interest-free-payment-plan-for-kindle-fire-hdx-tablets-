If you’re looking to buy a Kindle Fire HDX, but don’t want to plunk down the full $229 or $379 all at once, Amazon now offers a payment plan  that lets you pay the tablet off in four interest-free payments over the course of nine months. Introduced on Amazon’s homepage over the weekend and spotted by AllThingsD , the offer appears to be for the holidays only, available through December 24.
The payment plans are good for either the $229 7-inch Kindle Fire HDX or the $379 Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 . All you have to do is accept the offer on Amazon, add the Kindle to your cart, and at checkout you’ll be charged 25 percent of the tablet’s price, along with any applicable tax and shipping charges in full. After that, you’ll automatically be billed for the balance in three equal payments every 90 days. You can also choose to pay the full remaining balance at any time.
Between this offer as well as last month’s 30-day free trials , it’s clear that Amazon is making a big push for the Kindle Fire HDX. It’s unclear how many tablets the retail giant has sold so far, though it claims that this year’s Black Friday sale was its best ever .
