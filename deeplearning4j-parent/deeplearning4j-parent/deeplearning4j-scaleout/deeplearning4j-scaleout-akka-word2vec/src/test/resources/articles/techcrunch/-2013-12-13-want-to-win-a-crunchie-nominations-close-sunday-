Crunchies Sizzle Reel
Every year the Crunchies , our annual awards show, defines what it means to be a startup. We bring the scrappiest, hard-workingest, and most amazing startups onstage and celebrate them at one of the most amazing events of the year. But we can’t celebrate you if you’re not nominated. Time is running out to nominate your favorite startup, founder, CEO and technology of the year. We’re closing nominations on December 15, so please hurry.
Co-hosted by TechCrunch, VentureBeat and GigaOm, the annual “Oscars of Tech” celebrates the best of the past year. But it’s you, the tech community, that nominates who among us will be most deserving to take the stage at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco on February 10th.
Included in the 20 categories are the Best Startup, Best Design, and Angel of the Year with GitHub, FiftyThree, and Chris Dixon taking those top prizes home last year, respectively. New for 2013 is the Best Health Startup in which we will recognize the company that best epitomizes the future of medicine.
