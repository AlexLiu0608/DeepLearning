Summary:
What would get your average teenager to ditch their favorite video chat app and switch to a competitor? Co-browsing may just be one of those features.
Rounds , the Tel Aviv-based video chat startup, added the ability to browse websites while you’re chatting with each other to its iPhone and Android app Tuesday. Rounds was able to add the shared browsing feature thanks to a cooperation with Channel.me , a Dutch startup that specializes in these kind of co-browsing experiences.
Check out a video of the app and the new feature below:
I’ve been pretty skeptical in the past of startups who are trying to leave their mark in the video chat space. It just seems increasingly difficult to compete with big players like Skype and Google Hangouts, as well as a handful of companies like ooVoo that have a grip on the teen market.
But every now and then, a feature comes along that could actually make a difference — and co-browsing on mobile devices could just be that kind of feature.
