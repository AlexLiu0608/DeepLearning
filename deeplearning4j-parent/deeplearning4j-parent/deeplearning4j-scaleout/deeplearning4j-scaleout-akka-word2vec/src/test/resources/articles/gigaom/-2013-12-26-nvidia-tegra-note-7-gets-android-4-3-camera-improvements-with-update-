Summary:
Nvidia Tegra Note 7 owners get a day-after holiday surprise in the form of a software update. Once updated over the air, the device supports left-handed stylus users and always on HDR camera functionality.
Nvidia must have worked through the holiday because on Thursday, it pushed a software update to Tegra Note 7 tablets around the world . Aside from bringing the 7-inch slate up to Android 4.3, Nvidia added new features for the slate’s stylus and camera. Owners of the device, which is sold under several brand including EVGA, ADVENT, Gigabyte, Shenzhen Homecare Technology, ZOTAC and XOLO, should see the software update available over-the-air.
Folks who use the included stylus should see an improvement; particularly if they’re left-handed. Nvidia added support for lefties and says the overall stylus experience is better. The tablet’s notification bar now shows when the stylus has been removed from or inserted into the device as well. New to the Note 7 is an always-on HDR function for the camera. Nvidia says its Tegra 4 chip with Chimera computational photography architecture and new video stabilization feature should provide better images when using the 5 megapixel camera. Users can also apps and app data files to a microSD card with this update.
It’s interesting to observe how Nvidia handles updates for the Note 7, as well as the company’s Shield gaming handheld built on Android. These are really the first big end-user consumer electronics products for Nvidia, which has traditionally been a chip-designer and graphics card maker. Products such as this pair require a different level of customer support and resources devoted towards improving the entire product experience.
So far, I think Nvidia is doing a decent job, although at this point, I think it really should be pushing Android 4.4 to the Note 7. Let’s see how long before we see that happen.
