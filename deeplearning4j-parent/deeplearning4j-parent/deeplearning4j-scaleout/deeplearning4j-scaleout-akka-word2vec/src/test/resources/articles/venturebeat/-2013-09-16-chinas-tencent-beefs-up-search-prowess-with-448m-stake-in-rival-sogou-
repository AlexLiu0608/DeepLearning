Tencent , China’s largest web company, announced today that it has poured $448 million into rival Chinese search engine Sugou , a move that further consolidates China’s big Internet firms.
The deal gives Tencent a 36.5 percent stake in Sugou, the search arm of Chinese web portal Sohu . The Wall Street Journal reports that Tencent plans to merge its smaller Soso search engine with Sogou. The two engines have a 3 percent and 9 percent market share in China, respectively. In comparison, competitor Baidu holds more than 80 percent of China’s search market.
At this point, all of China’s big web companies, including e-commerce giant Alibaba, are trying to diversify their businesses. The deal not only gives Tencent a gateway into Sohu’s search business, it also keeps others from snapping up Sugou, Forrester Research analyst Bryan Wang told the WSJ.
