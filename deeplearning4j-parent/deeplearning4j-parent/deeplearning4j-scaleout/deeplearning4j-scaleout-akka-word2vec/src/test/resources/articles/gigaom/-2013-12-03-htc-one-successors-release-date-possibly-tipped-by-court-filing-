Summary:
A court filing published today suggests the successor to the HTC One could arrive “as early as February 2014.”
No matter what you call the successor to the HTC One – the HTC M8 , the HTC Two, or maybe even the HTC One 2 – it looks like it could arrive early next year. That’s according to a court filing published today, which states the new phone might appear “as early as February 2014.”
The filing was published as part of Nokia’s sales injunction on the HTC One and One Mini due to patent infringement. The document reads:
HTC is close to launching the successor flagship model to the HTC One. HTC has not revealed the launch date. Nokia has adduced evidence which suggests that the launch date is in the first quarter of 2014 and possibly as early as February 2014. HTC has not contradicted this.
February 2014 will mark nearly a year since the HTC One first went on sale, so that sounds about right. Further details about the new phone are scarce, though it is rumored to feature a 5-inch 1080p display and Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor.
