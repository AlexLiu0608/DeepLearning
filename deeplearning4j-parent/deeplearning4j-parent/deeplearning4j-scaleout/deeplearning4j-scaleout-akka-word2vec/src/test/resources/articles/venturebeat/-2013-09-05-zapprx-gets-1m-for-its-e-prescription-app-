ZappRx  just launched its mobile application that makes it easier for anyone to pickup a prescription at the pharmacy.
A few months after it hit the App Store, the startup has secured $1 million in seed funding, demonstrating investors’ surging interest in health IT.
Chief executive Zoe Barry got the idea when waiting to board a flight at the airport. That prompted her to think about the experience of standing on a line at the pharmacy. She wondered whether a “mobile boarding pass” for the pharmacy would help speed up the experience, and reduce the risk that pharmacists would dole out the wrong prescription or dose.
ZappRx is an application for now, but the Boston and New York-based team is forging relationships with doctors. Soon, Barry hopes that doctors will be able to digitally prescribe medications to their patients (so you can skip that trip to the doctor’s office altogether), and patients will be able to pay for prescriptions online.
Likewise, pharmacists will be able to access and process patient’s insurance information, so you’ll simply pickup your prescription and go.
ZappRx is currently working with a handful of doctors, but the company claims that it will continue to forge partnerships with large hospitals in the coming months.
In its first months, Barry tested the application with New York-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medical Center and the independent Zitomer Pharmacy.
The funding comes from Atlas Ventures Jean-Francois Formela and Ryan Moore, along with Life Sciences Angel Network, Hakan Satiroglu, among others. Jay Silverstein, a founding member of Oxford Health, Will Cowen founder of NaviNet, and George Kassabgi, founder of Keas, will join the company in an advisory role.
