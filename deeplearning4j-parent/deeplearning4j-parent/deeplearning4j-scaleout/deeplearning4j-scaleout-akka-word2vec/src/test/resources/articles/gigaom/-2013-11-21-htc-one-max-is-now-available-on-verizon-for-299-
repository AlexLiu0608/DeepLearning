The HTC One Max has already been available on Sprint for almost a week, but you can now pick up the tremendous smartphone at Verizon Wireless as well. The carrier quietly launched the phone on Thursday. It costs $299.99 with a two-year contract, or $25.22 per month on Verizon Edge . Sprint is offering the phone for $249.99 on-contract, along with an additional $100 off for new customers that bring their old phone number. Iâ€™ve been testing a review unit of the HTC One Max over the last week, and plan to post my thoughts on it soon.
