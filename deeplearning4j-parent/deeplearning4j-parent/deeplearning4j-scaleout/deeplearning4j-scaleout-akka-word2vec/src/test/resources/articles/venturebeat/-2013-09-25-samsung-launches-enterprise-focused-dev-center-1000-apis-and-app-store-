Samsung announced this morning that it has created the Samsung Solutions Exchange , a new ecosystem for enterprises that are adopting Android phones. The Exchange will not only offer apps specifically for business, it will also be a place where third-party developers and businesses with unique needs can meet and close deals — and it gives enterprises access to Samsung’s own device software development kit and 1,000 “enterprise APIs.”
Happy birthday, Android!
This is a big deal for business, which Samsung promises will deliver holistic solutions for industries such as healthcare, financial services, government, transportation, retail, and education, as well as custom solutions for custom needs, and a range of offerings helping to drive the growing trend towards mobile technology in the hands of sales and service personnel in jobs that are mobile and often out-of-office.
And it’s a big deal for Android, which has had some challenges in the enterprise — not only with Apple, which has seen great success in enterprise , but also with Android’s well-known security issues , which this could help defuse.
“This engagement model is truly an industry first, aimed at achieving shared value across our rapidly growing ecosystem of enterprise customers, sales channels and alliances,” Samsung VP Timothy Wagner said in a statement. “We are launching the Samsung Solutions Exchange as a way to help our end customers accelerate their business success.”
It is an industry first, and stands in sharp contrast to Apple’s offerings. Apple also offers solutions for enterprises, but that is currently limited to tools and software to build and distribute apps in-house . Organizations that don’t have that capability — or want to move faster with the help of external partners — may find the Samsung Solutions Exchange a very helpful way of finding and connecting with suppliers.
In addition, the Exchange promises to be a more secure way to find and distribute enterprises apps, alleviating legitimate enterprise concern over Android security issues. It builds on Samsung’s enterprise-friendly SAFE program, which secures Android devices with 256-bit encryption, provides VPN connectivity, helps Android connect to Microsoft Exchange, and includes mobile device management tools.
American Airlines says the enterprise focus is working:
“We have deployed Samsung tablets to flight attendants and aircraft maintenance technicians, and leverage SAFE to help facilitate device management,” said Maya Leibman, the company’s CIO. “These, along with our other mobile solutions, give our employees more insights that ultimately result in better customer service.”
