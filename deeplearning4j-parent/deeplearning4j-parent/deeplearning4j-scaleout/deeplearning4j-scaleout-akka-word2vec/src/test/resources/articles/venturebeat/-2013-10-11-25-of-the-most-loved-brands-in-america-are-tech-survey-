The iPhone is the most beloved brand in America.
NewMediaMetrics released the results of its annual LEAP survey today, which indexed the 25 most loved brands in the U.S..
Fifty percent of them are tech, and most of these are gadgets.
Four of the top 25 are Apple. The company ranked as the fifth most loved brand, while the iPad and iPod came in 12th and 13th.
Google search ranks sixth and Google is ninth, with Google’s operating system Android at 20th.
Game consoles also did well. Sony’s PlayStation and Microsoft’s Xbox finished at 17th and 22nd, respectively.
Microsoft is also on the list for its Office suite of productivity software (15).
Samsung’s Galaxy Android smartphone is near the bottom of the list at 24th, and online stock-trading site E*trade finishes up at 25th.
LEAP stands for “Leveraging Emotional Attachment for Profit.” It aims to quantify (and rank) attachment for more than 400 brands.
It’s interesting that for all the talk of technology replacing meaningful human interaction and turning the world into a place ruled by digital devices, people (or Americans, at least) feel an emotional attachment to the products that connect us to the digital world.
Mobile devices are our portal to so many other things, and leaving home without your phone can be more anxiety provoking than forgetting your wallet or keys. With a phone, you can always call (or text or e-mail) someone for help.
Marketers build their career on creating brand awareness, engagement, and loyalty — that holy trifecta that keeps business rolling in and thriving for years.
Consumers can be fickle, particularly when it comes to technology. We always want the latest, coolest, fastest, smallest, sleekest thing, and it doesn’t take much for us to defect to another product, if the price is cheaper or the buzz is hotter.
But like marriage, brands and consumers alike want partners who are going to stick with them through thick and thin, who will let them know when things aren’t great and what they need to do to snap out of it.
Apple and Google both have a reputation for creating high-quality products, pushing innovation forward, and listening to their customers. It seems basic, but executing well on these core principles goes a long way.
Cars made up a significant portion of the list, and interestingly, travel and entertainment gained ground. Lexus ranked second, followed by Disney Cruise Lines and Disney Parks at third and forth. Seven of the top twenty-five brands are cars.
So drive your Lexus to Disney World while navigating on your iPhone should make you one very happy camper.
