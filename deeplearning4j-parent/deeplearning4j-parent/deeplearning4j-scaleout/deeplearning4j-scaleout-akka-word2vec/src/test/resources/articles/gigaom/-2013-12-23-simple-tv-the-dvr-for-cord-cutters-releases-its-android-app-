Simple.tv released its Android app this past weekend, giving owners of its DVR  a way to stream live and recorded TV to Android phones and tablets. Simple.tv is targeting cord cutters with a DVR that records free over-the-air digital TV and then streams it to mobile and connected devices. The company just started to sell its second-generation hardware , and is set to show off a cloud DVR offering at CES in Las Vegas next month. We first showed off Simple.tv’s Android app in a video a few weeks ago.
