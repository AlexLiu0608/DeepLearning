Sadly, few of us mobile warriors need classes in douchebaggery.
However, Google Glass has the potential to take our unintentional, distracted annoyingness to a totally new level. Like googling “diarrhea remedies” out loud in shopping mall. Or talking to people, but not really to people, if you get what I mean.
Enter Bluetooth Man, Google Glass Edition, stage left:
Comedian Ed Bassmaster teamed up with PRserve’s Chris Barrett to record how talking to your glasses just might be a little awkward, strange, and even creepy. Apparently, he agrees with our own Jolie O’Dell, who reviewed the device and found it isolating and dehumanizing , and others who find it annoying.
Realistically, of course, no one would ever use their Google Glass in such a patently offensive way — I hope. And with the bone conduction microphone, there is absolutely no need to shout out your queries and commands. The same douchebaggery is completely in evidence with anyone using a Bluetooth headset for their phone carelessly.
And, I’m certain, anyone with discretion can use Google Glass politely and privately.
Bassmaster has almost 1.5 million YouTube subscribers and makes a living doing odd, quirky videos on YouTube, although he’s currently also pitching his own TV show.
No word on whether the TV show involves Google Glass.
