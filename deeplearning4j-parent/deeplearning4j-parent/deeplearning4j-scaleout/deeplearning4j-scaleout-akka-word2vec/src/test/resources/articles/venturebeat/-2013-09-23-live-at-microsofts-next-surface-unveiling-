NEW YORK — Microsoft just unveiled the Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 at a swanky press event in Manhattan. Check out our live recap of the event below.
Microsoft surprised just about everyone last year when it unveiled the Surface , the first computer the software giant has ever made. While it looks just like a typical Windows 8 tablet at first glance, the Surface transforms into a fully-functioning laptop with one of its keyboard cases.
But for all of its hype, Microsoft’s first Surface was a disaster, thanks to an immature operating system in Windows RT and a glaring lack of apps. The Surface Pro , a slightly thicker and heavier device, fared better thanks to its beefier hardware and support for all existing Windows software.
