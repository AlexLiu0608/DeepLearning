Open source database startup RethinkDB has raised an $8 million series A round, led by Highland Capital Partners. Like MongoDB, RethinkDB is designed to store JSON documents, but it boasts features around administration, scalability and functionality that MongoDB doesn’t offer. Even getting close to MongoDB in terms of users (especially meaningful ones running in production) will be a tall order, but RethinkDB has raised $12.2. million in capital thus far, which isn’t exactly chump change when it’s all going right back into the product and the community.
