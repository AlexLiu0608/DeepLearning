On Friday, News Corp  announced that it acquired social news agency and “open newsroom experience” Storyful for €18 million (approximately $25 million USD). According to the press release, Storyful will continue to act as an independent entity within News Corp, and will likely execute deeper partnerships with the news umbrella’s original programming — including WSJ Live and BallBall in Asia. It’s new territory for News Corp, which has made its money on traditional and broadcast news, but Storyful could help with the pesky task of verifying information from Twitter and other social media platforms — an increasing asset in the breaking news world.
