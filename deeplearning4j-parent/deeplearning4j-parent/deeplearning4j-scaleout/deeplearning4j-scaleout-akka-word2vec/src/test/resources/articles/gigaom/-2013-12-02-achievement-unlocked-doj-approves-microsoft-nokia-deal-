There’s one less hurdle for Microsoft’s deal to purchase Nokia’s mobile hardware division for $7.2 billion . This past weekend, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) approved the deal in the U.S. leaving EU regulator approval as the final step according to ZDNet’s Mary Jo Foley. The EU is expected to render a quick decision — as early as December 4 — which would keep Microsoft on track for a first quarter 2014 closure of the deal. The purchase is more of a formality and business management deal as Nokia is already the leading handset maker of phones running Microsoft’s Windows Phone software.
