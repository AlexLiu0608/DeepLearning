BitCoin’s Volatility, Draper’s Six Californias, Jack Dorsey’s Square Equity
We might be heading into the height of the holiday season, but tech news has not slowed down just yet! So we had quite a few things to discuss in CrunchWeek , the TechCrunch TV show that brings together three writers to talk about the hottest news stories of the past seven days.
In this episode, Leena Rao , Alex Wilhelm and I talk about the big crash that cut the value of the Bitcoin currency in half (and the latest law enforcement crackdowns on the new Silk Road 2 exchange), the far-out proposal by renowned technology venture capitalist Tim Draper to split California into six pieces and turn Silicon Valley into its own state, and Square founder Jack Dorsey giving back 10 percent of his equity in the company.
