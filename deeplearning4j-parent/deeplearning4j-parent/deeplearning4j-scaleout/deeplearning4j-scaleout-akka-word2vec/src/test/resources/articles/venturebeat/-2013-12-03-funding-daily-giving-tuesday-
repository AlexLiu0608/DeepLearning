Today is Giving Tuesday — the next T-day after Thanksgiving that bookends a weekend of spending that follows the one day we’re supposed to give thanks for what we already have.
Seems VCs were happy to give millions of dollars to startups, albeit not exactly altruistically. One of the most interesting, and most deserving companies we saw today was a really cool new medical tool: tumor paint. This “paint” helps doctors to literally see which cells are cancerous and which are healthy, so no extra healthy cells get the boot in surgery.

Tumor Paint helps doctors cut the cancers, not healthy tissue, from kids’ brains
On an MRI scan, cancer is easy enough to spot. But during surgery, these cells can look remarkably similar to the healthy ones, which are often cutout by accident. So Olson, a Seattle-based pediatric neuro-oncologist, set out to develop technology to help surgeons better differentiate between cancerous and healthy tissue. What he came up with is a new product called Tumor Paint, which illuminates cancer cells with fluorescent dye. Armed with promising early test results, the company received $9 million in fresh second round financing today from individual investors, primarily biotech executives, and parents of Olson’s patients. To date, Blaze Bioscience has raised $19 million. Read the full story on VentureBeat .
