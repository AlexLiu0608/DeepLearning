The startup already has an iPad app, but Sims said in an interview that building a coding app for a much smaller screen size was a daunting challenge. And because trying to write code on a smartphone is such an impossible proposition, few or no other companies have attempted similar schemes.
Ultimately, Sims’ philosophy is that an early education in coding (or other digital skills) can save modern students and future employees the immense investment of time and money that a four-year university degree requires.
“Codecademy on the web has helped millions of people learn the programming skills they need in order to be successful in a digital economy,” Sims said. “We’re intent on closing the gap between education and employment for digital skills, and we’re just getting started.
“One of the most frequent requests we got from our learners was a way to learn on the go in the spare minutes that they’d otherwise use playing a game or surfing the web. … We’re hoping to introduce anyone anywhere to the hour of code to get them interested in programming. the iPhone is a super easy to use platform that kids everywhere are glued to — this will hopefully replace an hour of something like Candy Crush [Saga]!”
And for that use case, a simple iPhone app works perfectly.
As far as Codecademy as a whole, Sims said he characterizes the business as “healthy! We have millions of people that have used Codecademy and many that have been quite successful. Two of Time‘s top 50 websites this year were created by people who learned on Codecademy in the last year. beyond entrepreneurs, we’ve got 6,000-plus schools using our Codecademy after school kits all over the world and individuals learning at their own pace.”
