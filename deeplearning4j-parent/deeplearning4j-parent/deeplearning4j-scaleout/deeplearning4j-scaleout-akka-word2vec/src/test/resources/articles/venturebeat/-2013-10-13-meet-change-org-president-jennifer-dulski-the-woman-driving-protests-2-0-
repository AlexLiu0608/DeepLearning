On both sides of the Atlantic, entrepreneurs are proving that you can make money and do good at the same time.
This trend,  which the media often call “social entrepreneurship,”  scarcely existed a decade ago. But it’s thriving today with the support of impact investors and high-profile policymakers, such as U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
In Silicon Valley, a startup called  Change.org  is fast becoming the poster child for the movement. At its helm is an energetic young founder, Ben Rattray, and a seasoned technology executive, Jennifer Dulski. Since launching in 2007, the San Francisco-based company, which gives people a way to create and conduct online petitions, has raised more than $15 million from eBay founder Pierre Omidyar’s investment firm, Omidyar Network .
On Change.org, ordinary people have started petitions to fight local and national governments, corporations, and human rights violations — and won.
Dulski, 41, is the most recent addition to Change.org’s executive team. She first came across the website in 2011, when the parents of Trayvon Martin posted a  petition to prosecute their son’s killer , whom police had initially failed to charge. Almost 2.3 million people signed that petition, and she was one of them.

At the time, she had a high-paying, high-level position at Google’s shopping and ads group, a position she assumed after becoming the first woman to sell a company (a deals merchant called DealMap) to Google.
She left Google for Change.org, and nine months after being named president and chief operating officer, VentureBeat asked Dulski to discuss her new role. We asked Dulski how she is working to encourage more people (especially young women) to take a stand, and her advice for becoming a social entrepreneur.
Considering starting a ‘tech for good’ business?
Dulski has founded companies and joined startups in the early stages. She started her career by founding a nonprofit: an academic program to help disadvantaged kids in urban Pittsburgh go to college.
Her advice to would-be social entrepreneurs is to prepare for extreme highs and plenty of setbacks. For example, it took Change.org’s founder the better part of two years to settle on a profitable business model.
She also recommends publicly committing to your company’s mission, as you may face pressure from potential investors to sell, go public, or otherwise “put short-term profit ahead of your vision.”
You’ve also got to consider your users, and create a compelling experience. “A social good business needs to do the same thing as a traditional business: answer consumer demand,” she said. Change.org aims to solve the challenge that ordinary people don’t have the tools to make an impact on the issues that mattered to them.
However, not everyone is cut out to start a business. For people whose talents are best suited to a specific functional role, she recommends joining an early-stage social good business and helping it scale.
Activism 2.0: Is the Internet the new way to protest?
Dulski is leading a team of Change.org employees, who are performing in-depth analysis on how people engage with petitions.
She noticed one particularly interesting trend: More women sign petitions than men, but more men start petitions. Roughly equal numbers of men and women win petitions. So now, she’s working on various projects to encourage more women to start petitions, “as women are just as capable,” she says.
