Now that the new Mac Pro is available , Apple has seen fit to release a big update to Final Cut Pro X . Version 10.1 brings a number of new features, including full 4K support as well as optimization to take advantage of the dual GPUs in the new Mac Pro.
The most significant new feature is full support for 4K content. Final Cut Pro now supports video monitoring up to 4K via Thunderbolt 2 and HDMI on “select” Mac computers (these likely include the new Mac Pro and the MacBook Pro with retina display, which both use Thunderbolt 2). There’s also support for 4K content including titles, transitions and generators, so you can now upload 4K video straight to the Web.
And because Mac Pros and Final Cut Pro go so well together, another big part of the update includes optimized playback and rendering using the dual GPUs in the new Mac Pro. There’s a bunch of other new tweaks and features as well, and you can view the release notes here .
The update is available as a free download to all existing Final Cut Pro owners. For new users, Final Cut Pro X is available for $299.99 from the Mac App Store .
