OwnCloud  has raised $4.4 million out of a proposed $7 million round, according to a filing  with the Securities & Exchange Commission.  That shows that Dropbox and Box , with their multibillion-dollar valuations, haven’t sucked all the air out of the cloud file storage, share and sync market.
The Lexington, Mass.-based company’s claim to fame is it lets companies securely place and store their files in their cloud of choice — Amazon Web Services, whatever — while also pledging users Dropbox-like ease of use.
The company netted $820,000 in first round funding  two years ago, and another $2.5 million  last year. General Catalyst, which participated in both earlier rounds, is back again this time out. Other investors were not disclosed.
