In a boost for Berlin, U.K.-headquartered King  – one of the world’s top social games providers – has today announced it will be opening a new games studio in the German capital. The studio will open in the beginning of 2014, with the company already on the lookout for talent.
King will announce its new Berlin director at the beginning of next year. The company already has offices in San Francisco, Barcelona, Bucharest, London, Malmö and Stockholm.
King’s CEO Riccardo Zacconi said: “Germany is the home of many exceptional games developer talents and Berlin is one of the leading creative metropolises for our industry in Europe.” Hoping to capitalise on this talent pool, the company is currently building its Berlin team  (before you jump at the opportunity,  find out how King hires ).
Undoubtedly, King will be competing for staff with its Berlin-based rival, Wooga – the company behind popular games Jelly Splash and Diamond Dash. King is already on the offensive, highlighting the benefits and pointing out that it was recently labeled as Sweden’s best employer in today’s media release.
King claims that it amasses over one billion plays per day globally – not hard to believe if you’ve been sucked in by the addictiveness of its best-performing game, Candy Crush. It offers games on Facebook, mobile and on its website King.com.
