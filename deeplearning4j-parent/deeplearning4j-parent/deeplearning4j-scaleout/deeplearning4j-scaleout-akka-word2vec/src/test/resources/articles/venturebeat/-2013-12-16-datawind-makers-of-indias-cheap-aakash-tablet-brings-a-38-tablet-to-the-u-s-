Datawind’s mission to deliver ultra-cheap tablets for everyone, no matter their income, is finally headed to the U.S.
Today the Canadian company announced that it will offer three of its 7-inch Android UbiSlate tablets in the United States, with the cheapest (the UbiSlate 7ci) running for a mere $38.
The news follows the company’s launch of the $35 Aakash2 tablet (which shares the UbiSlate’s hardware) last year in India. It’s been two years since Datawind and India first announced the Aakash tablet project , and even though the first version of that tablet had a plethora of issues (it was slow and unresponsive, for one), the upgraded hardware in the Aakash2 proved that an ultracheap tablet could actually be usable.
The UbiSlate 7ci’s specs — a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core processor, only 8 gigabytes of storage — sound puny compared to most tablets, even Google’s cheap Nexus 7. But, in this case, having specs that are merely “good enough” is essential for reaching that $38 price.
Datawind says it’s focusing on the 20 percent of Americans who currently don’t have any Internet access. Ultra-cheap tablets like the UbiSlate could also be ideal for classrooms that can’t afford to shell out $200 per device for current low-end tablets.
While the $38 UbiSlate relies on Wi-Fi for web access, Datawind will also offer a year of mobile connectivity with a slightly upgraded model, the UbiSlate 7C+, for $100 (without mobile web, it will cost $80). A higher-end UbiSlate 3G7 model will cost $150 with a year of Internet access, or $130 on its own. Both tablets will push mobile data through Datawind’s servers to speed up load times.
Speaking to the Washington Post , Datawind CEO Suneel Sing Tuli laid out an even more ambitious goal of producing a $20 tablet in the next two years. That may seem impossible today, but then again, so did the idea of a $35 tablet a few years ago.
