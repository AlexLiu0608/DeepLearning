If you follow VentureBeat but don’t regularly check our GamesBeat site, here’s a list of the best video game stories we ran over the last seven days that you may have missed.
This week, Apple reveals its new 64-bit processor chip for iPhone that could revolutionize mobile gaming, Sony announces a thinner (less beautiful) Vita as well as a Vita-based microconsole, and Valve announces a game-sharing component for Steam which allows players to share games with up to 10 authorized friends. We also interview Marcus “djWheat” Graham on how he became the iconic “voice” of e-sports.
You’ll also find reviews for Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, Card Hunter, The Wonderful 101, and Kingdom Hearts 1.5 HD Remix.
