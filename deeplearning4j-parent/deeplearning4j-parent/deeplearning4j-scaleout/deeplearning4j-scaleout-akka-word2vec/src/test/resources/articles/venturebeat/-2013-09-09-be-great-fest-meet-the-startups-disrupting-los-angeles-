The Los Angeles startup revolution begins in less than a month at Be Great Fest 2013 . On Sept. 17,  tech incubator Be Great Partners hosts L.A.’s most disruptive entrepreneurs, top investors, creative talent, celebrities, and other startup supporters for a night of celebration and innovation at the Pacific Designer Center.
As previously reported , Be Great Fest will unite elite professionals from L.A.’s diverse industries to promote startup growth and tech culture in Los Angeles.
Already ranked as the No. 3 global startup ecosystem by the Startup Genome Project, L.A. startups attracted over $847 million in investment last year alone. Economic advantages and access to the entertainment industry position Los Angeles to become No. 1 global startup ecosystem within the next few years. At Be Great Fest on Sept.17, Be Great Partners will provide an evening uniquely crafted to bolster this potential.
Attendees can expect a night of exclusive networking opportunities, live entertainment, gourmet catering by chef Wolfgang Puck, and special guests. Additionally, the evening features special exhibits and demonstrations by Be Great Partners ’ portfolio companies and other L.A. startup stars.
Let’s take a closer look at the next generation of disruptive startups you’ll meet at Be Great Fest:
