Flat design enhances contrasts
 Yes, IOS 7 design is finally flat, replacing the real-world object mimicry of skeuomorphic design. Flatness, it turns out, supports color contrasts and makes UIs easier to use.
 Single color contrasts with flat white spaces are efficient choices for UIs. They focus the eye on major tasks and help avoid clutter. On the calendar app, for example, bright red circles identify dates clearly while red typefaces emphasize navigation buttons. In a skeuomorphic calendar, gray shades would compete with reds for attention and take up too much space. Instead, the flat buttons pop off the screen. The red-white contrast also has the emotional effect of playfulness as opposed to alarmist, because of the red’s place in the orange/magenta spectrum.
Aaris Sherin, Associate Professor of graphic design at St. John’s University, says contrast-centered design is needed to overcome the limitations of mobile devices.
“Colors need to work for viewing on the reduced size of a person’s phone. There has to be enough contrast between hues for visual differentiation on a small scale and there must be adequate contrast with any background.” The high contrast ratio between the thin fonts and white backgrounds is one feature that clears out available space and makes the font easier to read.
“Color linking” thinking that ties in to the icon color is another space-saving feature, according to Harrington. The color helps a user know his location and allows him to concentrate on content. “[On iOS 7], Notes is yellow, iTunes is red, Clock is black, Mail is blue…they are working to use color as an identifier and quick reference. You see [this type of] red text and you know you’re in iTunes.” Even though users become used to UI navigations after a time, color linking makes the experience feel gracefully swift.
The most talked-about color contrasting comes in the form of “glass” transparencies. When the grey-hued glass sits on top of app and background layers, colors are transformed from sharp to diffuse (adding gray always makes color lose saturation). Harrington says this creates dynamic backgrounds that make the monochromatic icons and fonts on the glass stand out. It’s also effective from an emotional point of view. Like the purple hues, transparencies grant the UI with a dual complementary feel of simplicity and complexity.
