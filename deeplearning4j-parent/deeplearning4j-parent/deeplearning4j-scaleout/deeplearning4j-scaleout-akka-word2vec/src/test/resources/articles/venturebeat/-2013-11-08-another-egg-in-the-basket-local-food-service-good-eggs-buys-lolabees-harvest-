A lot of people love fresh, locally grown food. And a lot of those folks are also too busy (or lazy) to go to a farmer’s market.
Good Eggs  is a service for those people — and beginning today, they’ll have even more choices.
Founded in 2011, the local grocery delivery company just acquired LolaBee’s Harvest , a competing service in the San Francisco Bay Area, to expand its network of participating farmers and businesses. Good Eggs operates an online marketplace where you can buy high-quality, sustainably produced food from farmers and foodmakers in your community.
“We want to get more folks eating local food and getting to know their farmers and foodmakers,” Cathy Bishop, Good Eggs’ head of marketing, told VentureBeat. “By combining the LolaBee’s community of customers and producers with ours, we’re helping more people find great local food, and continuing to build a better food system.”
LolaBee’s will shut down its all accounts and move its customers to Good Eggs, which is a larger, venture-backed service with national aspirations. Good Eggs is “serving more customers and helping more local farmers and artisans than we have been able to do on our own,” wrote Lauren Bass, the founder of LolaBee’s Harvest, in  a blog post  about the acquisition.
In September, the San Francisco-based Good Eggs  raised $8.5 million  to support pilot programs in Brooklyn, Los Angeles, and New Orleans and set up operations in other metropolitan areas across the country. Sequoia Capital is a major backer.
Good Eggs works with more than 350 local food vendors.
