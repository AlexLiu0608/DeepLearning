SANTA MONICA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–November 19, 2013–
Los Angeles tech firms Nativo and Preact were recognized as two of the       region’s hottest startups at last week’s LA       Tech Summit , event organizer Cornerstone       OnDemand announced today.
Nativo ,       which was selected as the “hottest LA startup” by a panel of prominent       Los Angeles early stage and angel investors, is a leading native       advertising platform for publishers and advertisers. The Nativo platform       fully automates the scalable insertion of brand content into editorial       streams across mobile, tablet and desktop. Brand content is delivered       seamlessly cross-site and cross-device, matched in real-time to the look       and feel of each publication and consumed as site–served content on each       publisher domain. Preact ,       which the audience voted as their choice for LA’s hottest startup, is an       enterprise SaaS company that helps businesses provide a better customer       experience with tools that assist with churn reduction, engagement,       onboarding- and support.
Other Los Angeles startups competing in the session included Lettuce, a       mobile order management system for SMBs, and Prosperio, a media planning       tool for agencies, marketers and publishers.
The four young companies shared their stories and plans for the future       during a main stage pitch session held live in front of conference       attendees. The panel, led by Upfront Ventures investor Greg Bettinelli,       shared commentary and feedback on each presenting company.
