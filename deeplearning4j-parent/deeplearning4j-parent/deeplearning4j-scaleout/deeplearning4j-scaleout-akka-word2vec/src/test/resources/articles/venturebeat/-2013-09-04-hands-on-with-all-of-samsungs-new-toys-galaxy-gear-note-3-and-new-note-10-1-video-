Samsung Galaxy Gear hands-on 1 Source: Devindra Hardawar/VentureBeat
The Gear felt solidly built, though it was surprising to see the visible screws at the front. The rubber band felt comfortable against my wrist, and the metal clasp was easy to close. The clasp is worth noting, since it makes the Gear feel more like a designer watch than a gadget. While the Gear fit my wrist without issue, I can’t see people with thin wrists easily rocking it.
One big annoyance reared its head as soon as I put on the smartwatch: It was often confused about the orientation of my wrist, which ended up flipping the display upside down. I’m hoping this is just a minor software issue that Samsung can adjust easily, because in day-to-day use this would get annoying very quickly.
In the short time I spent with the Gear, I was impressed by Samsung’s simple approach to smartwatch navigation. You simply tap the screen to dive into an app or select an option, swipe left or right for other screens, and swipe down from the top bezel to go back. With a screen that’s just 1.63 inches, Samsung needed to implement simple and efficient user interface gestures — it shows that a lot of thought went into the interface design.

While it’s nice to see Samsung continuing to innovate with its stylus-equipped Note lineup, both devices are fairly minor upgrades over last year’s models. They’re slightly lighter and thinner, have comfy faux leather backs, and offer some smarter integration with the S Pen stylus, but these new models won’t convince anyone new to adopt a large 5.7-inch phablet or spend extra for an Android tablet with a stylus.
