Up until now, the only giant glaring negative about purchasing one of Google’s Chromecast streaming media sticks over other set-top boxes was the lack of available supported apps.
Today, however, Google announced a wave of 10 new Chromecast apps from some very notable third-party services. In terms of content services, there are now new apps for online TV network Revision3, music recommendation service Songza, the Washington Post’s PostTV, and music video service Vevo as well as Redbull.tv, Viki, and BeyondPod.
Chromecast also has support for new Plex, Avia, or RealPlayer Cloud apps — meaning you can now access all your locally stored media via your TV screen while using Chromecast’s easy screen mirroring feature.
The move to beef up the Chromecast library of supported apps probably has something to do with this year’s holiday shopping season. The device is already among the cheapest for streaming media to your TV at $35, and now it has plenty of support for most of the services people are probably seeking. (Chromecast already supports Netflix, YouTube, Hulu , Pandora , HBO Go , Google Play Music All Access, and a few others.)
And for those who already have a Chromecast, these new apps should make the device much more useful.
