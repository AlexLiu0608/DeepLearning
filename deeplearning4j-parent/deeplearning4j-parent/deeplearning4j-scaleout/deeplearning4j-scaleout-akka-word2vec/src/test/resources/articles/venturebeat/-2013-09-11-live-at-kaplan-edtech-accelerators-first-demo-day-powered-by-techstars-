NEW YORK — We’re here at IAC’s headquarters for the first demo day from Kaplan’s EdTech Accelerator , which has the backing of startup accelerator powerhouse TechStars .
The three-month program, which ran from June to September, offered 10 education technology startups the typical accelerator fare: office space, mentors, and $20,000 in funding (from TechStars). The company also had access to the “Kaplan Way for Learning” program, which brings together science, technology, and instructional design to create learning-based products.
Kaplan, a subsidiary of the Washington Post company, claims it’s the first corporate-sponsored accelerator focused on education.
Andy Rosen, Kaplan’s chairman and CEO, kicked things off by discussing the legacy of his company’s founder, Stan Kaplan. “Everything that we think about education today stems in some measure from this man, and the notion of meritocracy that we think of as a core part how our higher-education system works, owes a lot to Stan Kaplan,” Rosen said.
“These companies are literally pulling us into the future of education,” said Don Burton, the program’s managing director at TechStars. He notes that they’re focused on three critical areas: Smarter learning experiences, smarter and invididualized pathways to learning, and smarter learning scorecards.
Burton also announced today that TechStars will extend this accelerator program with Kaplan for several more years. “We’re exploring other opportunities as well,” he said, which may hint at future partnerships with learning companies.

The startups
The pitch: Airbnb for student jobs.
Funding: Raising $1.5 million, has $900,000 committed.
Most college students don’t have the necessary work experience to land decent jobs when they graduate. Flinja aims to solve that by offering training exclusively to college students and connecting them to companies looking for talent. CEO Victor Young points out that only 3 percent of LinkedIn’s users are between 18 and 24, and he hopes to fill that gap.
Flinja turns students into “freelance ninjas,” enabling them to accept jobs from companies like Xerox, Yelp, and Burger King as well as smaller startups. Young announced today that Flinja has more than 100,000 students signed up and more than 3,500 employers offering jobs. Over the past six months, Flinja has placed 2,200 jobs, typical work hours went from 10 hours to 20 hours, and job fulfillment time went down from two weeks to two days.
The pitch: Personalized literacy solutions using current news content.
Funding: Raising $1.2 million, $900,000 committed.
Newsela uses daily news to helps students become readers of nonfiction, but the real magic is that it offers personalization and data. The site grabs articles from top publishers and offers them at reading levels from grade three to adult. Reading levels are calculated automatically, but students can also increase their levels.
“Now students in the same class that are struggling, on track, and advanced can all read the same great nonfiction together,” said Newsela CEO Matthew Gross.
The company has won a grant from the Gates Foundation for next-generation literacy tools. In the past 12 weeks, it has grown to 3,742 schools with more than 120,000 poll questions asked. Newsela is seeing 11-times growth every day.
