Summary:
Chromebooks are already priced relatively low, yet this Friday, they’ll be even lower. I found not one, but two deals for the HP Chromebook 14, which can save you a $100 on the purchase.
We still have a few days to wait for Black Friday ads to appear, however the details of those details are leaking out. And those looking to buy an HP Chromebook 14 will have at least two money-saving options.
Staples may have the sweetest deal: It will sell the Chromebook for $179.
Meanwhile, Best Buy will be selling the $299 edition of HP’s Chromebook 14 for $199 while including a $30 Google Play Credit.
Both devices use the same Intel Celeron chip and come with 16 GB of flash storage and 100 GB of free Google Drive storage.
This post was updated at 12:32pm to remove mention of the Intel Haswell chips as these Chromebooks appear to use the prior generation chip.
