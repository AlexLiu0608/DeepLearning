Summary:
Can we build a brand new American energy system, the future of computer science, what Paul Krugman thinks of Bitcoins, a Californian chef in Copenhagen, President Obama and climate change — that’s the menu for this week.
And with this edition, another year of doing these emails comes to an end. I hope you will continue to read these newsletters in the year to come. Wishing you all a very happy 2014.
How America can build an innovative new energy system . A long essay from David Hart and Richard Lester is a must read, even if you don’t agree with their proposals. It comes via Scholars Strategy Network. 
Obama and climate change – The real story . Rolling Stone continues to deliver great journalism, this time from author  Bill Mckibben .
Find starters, not stars : Dan Shanoff of Neiman Journalism Lab pours a cold glass of reality on the recent buzz about “stars” and “band of brothers” malarky doing the rounds in East Coast media circles. His message — don’t conflate popularity and the ability to build a new property. 
Bits and Barbarism : Paul Krugman is a great economist. And he is a great blogger/columnist. This piece about gold and bitcoins is simply money. Pun intended of course. 
The future of computer science : John Hopcroft of Cornell University lays out how he views the world is going to change and what are going to be topics of the future — probably the smartest thing you will read today. ( Here is a link to the PDF paper .)
eBooks are reading you , says the New York Times.
Comfortable Gourmet – the story of a San Diego born chef and Copenhagen industrial water front.
