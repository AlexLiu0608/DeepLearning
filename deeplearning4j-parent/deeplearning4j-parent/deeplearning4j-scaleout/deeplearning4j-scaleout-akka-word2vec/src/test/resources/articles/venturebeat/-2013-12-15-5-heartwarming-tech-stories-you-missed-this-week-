Homeless coder prevails over skeptics – releases mobile app to get off the streets
Homeless coder Leo Grand
When Patrick McConlogue announced his intention to teach a homeless man to code, the Internet unleashed its wrath. Now about three months later, Leo “Journeyman” Grand released a mobile app called  “Trees for Cars.”  It is available on iOS and Android for a buck, and Grand gets 70 cents for every download. The hope is that enough people will download the app that Grand will be able to afford a home, find a job, and/or pay for school.
