After delivering its KitKat update to Google last week , Android 4.4 is officially rolling out to the Google Play edition of the HTC One smartphone now. Users on the XDA Developers forum have reported seeing the update, and the Verge just saw its device updated this morning .
The update weighs in at a hefty 300MB download, and includes lots of helpful new features like printing capabilities, keyboard emoji, an improved phone app and improved performance all around. The update is rolling out in stages, so it should be on its way if you haven’t received it yet. You can also download it directly from xda, but really, you’re better off waiting at this point.
It’s nice to see that HTC made good on its promise of a timely update for its Google Play-branded smartphone. It has pledged to update the rest of its HTC One smartphones on U.S. carriers to KitKat by the end of January .
