2D printing veteran HP  announced in October that it plans to enter the 3D printing market by mid-2014, but the details released since then have been slim. Wired reporter Robert McMillan was able to catch a glimpse of the prototype printer that sits in HP’s basement. He  described it as a “a five-foot tall giant of a machine cobbled together from existing jumbo-scale metal printing parts and some new custom-built equipment that HP isn’t ready to talk about.” HP has also developed a new plastic for the machine to use to make objects.
