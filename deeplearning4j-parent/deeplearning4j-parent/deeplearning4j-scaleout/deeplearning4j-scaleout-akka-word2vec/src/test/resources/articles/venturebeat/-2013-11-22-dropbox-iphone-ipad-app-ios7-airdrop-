Cloud storage service Dropbox looks a bit different on iPhone and iPad today.
On Thursday, Dropbox released new versions of its iOS apps, which now sport a whiter, more minimalistic user interface that brings the app in-line with other iOS 7 offerings.

The updated apps also include a few fresh features, like the ability to share links and files with nearby iOS 7 devices using Apple’s AirDrop function. And the iPad app now lets you toggle between a full-screen and split-screen interface (pictured right).
Competing cloud storage service Microsoft SkyDrive also released a new iOS app yesterday.
Dropbox also hinted at some tantalizing future news, saying the update “sets the stage for some exciting things to come” in a  blog post  announcing the revamped apps. Perhaps that has to do with the $250 million  funding round the company is reportedly raising from investors.
