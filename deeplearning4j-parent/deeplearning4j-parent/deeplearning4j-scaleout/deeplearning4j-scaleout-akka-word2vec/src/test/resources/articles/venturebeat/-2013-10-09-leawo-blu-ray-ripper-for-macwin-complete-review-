The above is just a brief description about the functions and features of Leawo Blu-ray Ripper. But what about its practical performance? Would this Blu-ray ripping software meet its claims? After a series of tests on multiple Blu-ray and DVD discs and folders, the following features within Leawo Blu-ray Ripper impressed us a lot:
Excellent Blu-ray decryption performance: “Leawo Blu-ray Ripper easily outranked its competitors in terms of functionalities and modifiable features. Perhaps most important to note is the program’s powerful, built-in decryption, which removes common Blu-ray copy protections and region codes that can block copying of the disc, including the latest AACS protections (AACS is the standard that has officially been adopted as the access restriction scheme for Blu-ray discs),” editors of TopTenReview said. Leawo’s Blu-ray Ripper could decrypt and rip Blu-ray discs with AACS, BD+ and the latest MKB protection, and rip CSS-DVD discs easily. Some latest released Blu-ray discs have been taken into test, including Man of Steel, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Lincoln, Zero Dark Thirty, and more. These Blu-ray discs are in various region codes. Leawo Blu-ray Ripper requires no effort to remove the disc protection and region code restriction. All these Blu-ray discs are smoothly decrypted and converted.
Abundant profiles available: Leawo’s Blu-ray Ripper offers users with 180+ profiles to choose as output format including like HD MP4, HD AVI, HD MOV, HD TS, HD TRP, HD VOB, HD MPG, HD WMV, HD ASF, MP4-AVC, MP4-XviD, MP4-H.264, AVI, ASF, WEBM, MOV, RMVB, FLV, F4V, TS, DAT, WMV, MKV, etc. This Blu-ray ripping software even offers preset profiles for specific devices like iPhone, iPad, iPod, Android devices, PSP, Windows Phones, etc. This saves a lot time and energy for users to get desired output profiles. What’s more, for advanced users, Leawo’s Blu-ray Ripper even allows them to custom the video and audio parameters of output profiles so as to make the output files more suitable to their devices, like video codec, bit rate, quality, aspect ratio, video size, frame rate, audio codec, channel, etc. With such abundant profiles preset, users could rip and convert Blu-ray/DVD to video or audio for multiple uses: playback on various media players, editing in iMovie or FCP (Mac version), or uploading to YouTube or blog for sharing.
Subtitle and audio tracks selecting: Leawo Blu-ray Ripper automatically detects the subtitle and audio tracks available on the disc and lists all the titles available, allowing users to select only the relevant pieces. The built-in player allows users to preview selected subtitles and audio tracks so as to make the final decision.
Advanced 2D to 3D converting: Leawo’s Blu-ray Ripper not only helps users convert Blu-ray/DVD movies but also allows users to create 3D movies out of 2D Blu-ray/DVD movies via the internal 2D to 3D converter. Users may create 3D movies in six different 3D effects: Red/Cyan, Red/Green, Red/Blue, Blue/Yellow, Interleaved, and Side by Side. The adjustable 3D depth could make the result 3D movies more vivid. People could choose to get one output file with 3D effect or all. Axel Gerken, the software editor of DownloadMix, said this software is “Highly Recommended” upon this amazing 3D movie creating capacity.
Practical video editing: Featuring an internal video editor, Leawo’s Blu-ray Ripper allows users to trim video length, crop video size, adjust video effect (brightness, contrast, saturation, volume zoom), apply image or text watermark, and more. The Mac version of Blu-ray Ripper even allows users to rotate videos for special angles of view.
Easy to use: Leawo’s Blu-ray Ripper is one of the easiest pieces of conversion software to use. It’s not complicated at all to download and install this Blu-ray ripping program on your computer. When you start, the program shows a quite simple and easy to understand guidance on the “import>set profile >convert” operating procedure. This program is easy to use for all levels of users — no technique knowledge required.
The converting speed and media preview might be not as impressive as the aforementioned shinning spots. To rip and convert a Blu-ray disc, it may take some time considering how large these files are. But Leawo Blu-ray Ripper ensures the high quality output video and audio after conversion. The media preview with the built-in media player is sometimes choppy, but it’s usually smooth and fluent as expected.
So, a clearer conclusion on the program’s pros and cons.

Wide support of video/audio formats and devices
