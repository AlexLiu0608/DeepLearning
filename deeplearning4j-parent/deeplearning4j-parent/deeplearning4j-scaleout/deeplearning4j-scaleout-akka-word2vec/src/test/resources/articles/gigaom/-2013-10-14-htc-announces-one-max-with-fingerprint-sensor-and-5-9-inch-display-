After a long month of leaks , the HTC One Max is finally here, and it’s pretty much everything we expected. HTC’s first true “phablet” features a humongous 5.9-inch display and rear-mounted fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone.
Essentially, the One Max is a very large version of the 4.7-inch HTC One released earlier this year, but a few interesting changes have been made in addition to the increase in size. There’s a fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone, and HTC’s Fingerprint Scan feature lets you use this sensor to unlock the phone. You can also launch different apps quickly by assigning an app to an individual finger. Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be any functionality to enter your fingerprint in place of passwords like you can on the iPhone 5s.
The phone is also running HTC’s new Sense 5.5 software, which we also saw a leak of last week . Sense 5.5 allows you to further customize HTC’s BlinkFeed menu and offers integration with services like Instagram and Google+.
The back cover of the phone is removable, unlike the HTC One, which means you can insert a microSD card for up to an additional 64GB of storage. Otherwise the phone comes in 16 and 32GB versions. You can’t remove the 3,300mAh battery, although HTC is offering an additional Power Flip case with a built-in 1150mAh battery.
Surprisingly, the One Max still uses the same quad-core 1.7GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor as the original One, which has since been eclipsed the Snapdragon 800 you’ll find in the LG G2 and Samsung Galaxy Note 3 .
Another potential pitfall is weight. The One Max tips the scales at a staggering 7.65 ounces. Yes, you get a very big screen, but Samsung has already showed that it can create a 5.7-inch phone at 5.93 ounces, which in my opinion is a lot more portable.
Other than that, this phone is pretty much similar to the HTC One, with the same UltraPixel rear camera and BoomSound front-facing speakers.
HTC claims the phone will start rolling out later this month, but there’s no word yet on pricing or availability in the US. You can see
