Now that Tesla Motors founder Elon Musk spent nearly $1 million buying the transforming submarine car from the James Bond move The Spy Who Loved Me, he wants to make it work.
Yes, that’s right. Musk plans to make the transforming submarine car from his childhood a reality — meaning you’ll be able to drive it straight into a deep lake and come out the other side without having to drain the vehicle or retrieve the waterlogged driver.
Here’s the statement Tesla gave Jalopnik about the aforementioned Bond car:
“It was amazing as a little kid in South Africa to watch James Bond in ‘The Spy Who Loved Me’ drive his Lotus Esprit off a pier, press a button and have it transform into a submarine underwater. I was disappointed to learn that it can’t actually transform. What I’m going to do is upgrade it with a Tesla electric powertrain and try to make it transform for real.”
Not only does this mean that the world will soon be getting a transforming Tesla-powered submersible vehicle, but it also helps proves a much more important theory of what we can expect from Musk at some point in the future: Musk is definitely (probably) going to build a real-life suit of Iron Man armor within our lifetimes.
