You get an iPad Air. You get an iPad Air! YOU get an iPad Air!
Ok, so Apple isn’t tossing out new iPads like Oprah, but the American tech giant is handing out some digital goodies to folks in the U.S. and abroad. The company just launched its annual “ 12 Days of Gifts ” campaign (formerly known as “12 Days of Christmas”), which promises to dole out a free gift from the iTunes, iBooks, and App Stores every day between Dec. 26 and Jan. 6.
Previously, Apple excluded Americans from participating in the giveaway, but this year’s app is available beginning today in the U.S., Europe, Japan, Russia, and other countries. It can be set to notify you every time a new gift is available. The free items will vary across territories.
There’s no indication of what Apple will dole out this year, but this reporter has been very good and would kindly like to request Infinity Blade III. Thank you,
Santa
Apple.
Here’s the official 12 Days of Gifts description:
From December 26 – January 6, you can download a gift each day — songs, apps, books, films, and more — with the 12 Days of Gifts app. Each day’s gift will only be available for 24 hours, so download the free app to make sure you don’t miss out. Please note: Not all content is available in all countries.
To kick things off, Apple is offering an early gift (at least to U.S. residents): a free download of the song ‘No Better’, a single from New Zealand singer-songwriter Lorde.
