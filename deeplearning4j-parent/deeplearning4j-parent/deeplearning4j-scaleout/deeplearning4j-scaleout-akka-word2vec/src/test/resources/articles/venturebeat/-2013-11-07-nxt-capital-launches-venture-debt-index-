First-ever study reveals the importance of venture debt as growth       capital for later-stage companies
BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–November 7, 2013–
NXT Capital’s Venture Finance Group ( www.nxtcapitalvf.com )       today announced the release of the inaugural edition of the NXT Capital       Venture Debt Index™. This first-of-its-kind analysis focuses exclusively       on venture debt financings between Q1 2012 and Q2 2013. The Venture Debt       Index™ reveals the important and growing impact of non-bank debt on       venture-backed companies and markets.
Among other findings, the NXT Capital Venture Debt Index™ confirms that       venture debt is an increasingly popular source of alternative financing       for later-stage companies seeking growth capital.

Key findings of the NXT Capital Venture Debt Index™ include:
Notable and Steady Capital Investment. With nearly $3.1 billion of         venture debt deployed over the last six quarters, the NXT Capital         Venture Debt Index™ confirms that venture debt averages 8% of all         capital flowing into venture-backed companies.
Based on the         dollars invested, transactions greater than $15 million account for         50% of total venture debt financings. Forty percent are between $5         million and $14.9 million and the remaining 10% consist of financings         below $5 million. The mean deal size is $7.1 million, which         demonstrates that venture-backed companies are receiving substantial         amounts of debt capital to help finance strategic initiatives.
Important Source of Growth Capital. The NXT Capital Venture Debt         Index™ reveals that debt financing is an essential source of growth         capital for companies late in their investment cycle. Since 2012,         companies that have been in operation for five to eight years account         for 33% of deployed venture debt dollars. For these and other         growth-stage companies, venture debt complements or replaces the need         for equity.
Geographic Diversity. Venture debt financings have a much broader         geographic distribution than venture capital investments. While 52% of         all venture capital dollars are invested in the state of California,         only 35% of venture debt transactions in the Index were with companies         based in that state. Additionally, nearly 40% of all venture debt was         deployed outside the top five geographic markets, while only 20% of         venture equity was invested outside these markets. Venture debt is         clearly filling a growing void in venture capital outside the         traditional hub cities.
For example, North Carolina         represents the fifth largest geographic concentration of venture debt         at 6% of total volume, yet is the 17th largest equity         market and accounts for only 1% of the total capital deployed.         Similarly, New Jersey accounts for 6% of total venture debt deployed,         yet the state received only 2% of total venture capital         dollars during the Venture Debt Index’s™ research period.
“We’re very pleased to release the first quantitative analysis of       venture debt’s prevalence and impact in fueling the innovation economy,”       said Jan Haas, Group Head, NXT Capital Venture Finance. “The NXT Capital       Venture Debt Index™ will continue to track the fund flows related to       debt-based growth capital and assess its influence in funding the growth       of venture-backed companies.”
“The market has become increasingly educated about the availability and       structural benefits of debt financing,” continued Haas. “The Index       reveals that debt is an appealing alternative for successful late-stage       companies seeking minimally dilutive growth capital across North       America.”
The NXT Capital Venture Debt Index™ is a proprietary analysis of       approximately 450 non-bank venture debt financings from the beginning of       2012 through the second quarter of 2013. It excludes loans made by       regulated banks unless provided by a venture debt-specific bank       affiliate. All benchmark venture capital data referenced above and in       the Index is from the PwC/NVCA MoneyTree™ Report based on data from       Thomson Reuters.
NXT Capital plans to update and expand the Venture Debt Index™ on a       regular basis.
