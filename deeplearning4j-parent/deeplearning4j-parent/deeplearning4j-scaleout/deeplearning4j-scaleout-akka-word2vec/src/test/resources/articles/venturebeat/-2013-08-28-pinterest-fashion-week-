Those with a sartorial eye will get even more pleasure out of Pinterest during Fashion Week. The company is creating pages dedicated to that special time of year when clothes become art and bringing in huge brand names at the same time.
Pinterest launched its New York Fashion Week page today with boards curated by truly some of the biggest brands at the shows, including Oscar de la Renta, Rebecca Minkoff, Michael Kors, Kate Spade, Diane Von Furstenberg, and at this point I’ve probably lost a lot of you to a Pinterest-induced fashion frenzy.
The boards don’t have many special features for the consumer other than a whole lot of eye-candy, but they represent a continued attempt on Pinterest’s part to bring more brands to the bookmarking site.
Pinterest has made an effort to give brands a special place on its website . A business account must agree to Pinterest’s special business terms of service, but it will also get features such as verified pages, analytics, and “ rich pins .” Rich pins include pricing for pinned items that area available for sale, where those items can be purchased, and if they’re in stock.
The company doesn’t seem to make money from these business accounts — signing up for one is free — but the more brands existing on Pinterest, the more opportunity for future revenue sources exists.
Pinterest is also jumping out of the web into your televisions through a partnership with Style Network. During the channel’s show, The ‘IT’ List: Top 10 Fall Trends, the host will mention popular pinners and other cool content on Pinterest. There will also be a Pinterest “Just Pinned” widget on the Style Network’s website.
Currently, Pinterest’s Fashion Week page is only up for New York, but London, Paris, and Milan are all coming soon.
