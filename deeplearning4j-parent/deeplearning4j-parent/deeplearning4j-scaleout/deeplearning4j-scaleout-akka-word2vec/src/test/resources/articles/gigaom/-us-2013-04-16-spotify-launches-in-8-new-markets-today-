Exciting times! Today we’re thrilled to announce that we’re bringing a new world of music to eight new countries across the globe. 
We’re taking our first steps in Latin America with Mexico, and Asia with Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore. Plus we’re thrilled to make new friends in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Iceland. 
This fantastic step now brings us to 28 markets and closer to our dream of making all the world’s music available instantly to everyone, wherever and whenever they want it.   
Spotify is the biggest and most successful music streaming service of its kind globally, with more than 24m active users and over 6m paying subscribers. Since its launch in Sweden in 2008, Spotify has driven more than half a billion US dollars to rights holders and expects to drive another half a billion US dollars to rights holders during 2013.
