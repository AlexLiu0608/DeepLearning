Jawbone, it seems, is a victim of its own success.
The hardware maker, which recently upgraded its Jambox wireless speaker , has seen considerable demand for its devices — so much that it hasn’t been able to scale its operations fast enough to meet that demand.
The solution? Raise more money. Fortune‘s Dan Primack reports that Jawbone has taken on over $100 million in new financing . Because it’s a lot quicker to borrow money than raise it through equity financing, the bulk — $93 million — comes via debt funding. The rest of the new money comes via a smaller $20 million equity round led by existing Jawbone investors like Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Khosla Ventures, and Sequoia Capita.
The funding, which Jawbone has yet to officially confirm to VentureBeat, joins the $200 million the company has raised so far.
All of this comes after a very busy few months for Jawbone, which has acquired companies like Massive Health and Bodymedia to help flesh out its vision for smart wearable devices. If it needs to take on some debt to fulfill that vision, so be it.
