Hewlett-Packard is still spearheading the PC, and today it is unveiling a bunch of business and education computers based on more efficient processors, touch technology, and tiny footprints.

HP Elitebook 1040 G1
The new products carry the HP Elite brand name for business computers. They include HP’s thinnest and most durable Elitebook, the HP EliteBook 1040 G1 laptop computer. It is 16.1 percent thinner at 15.9 millimeters and 7.3 percent lighter at 3.3 pounds than the previous generation, but it still passes a dozen military-grade tests for durability. It’s one of the machines HP says let you do more and carry less. This Ultrabook has a CNC aluminum unibody case.
It also has a cool new pressure-sensitive touchpad, developed by Synaptics. The HP ForcePad lets you use touch gestures that are similar to the kind you use with tablets and smartphones. If you press harder, you can scroll faster to the top or bottom of a web page you’re viewing. The machine has a 1080p 14-inch diagonal display with options for touchscreens or non-touch. It is available this month at $1,299 and has 10 hours of battery life.
Another new model is the HP EliteBook Folio 1040. It has optional 4G LTE wireless and the latest Intel fourth-generation dual-core i5 or i7 processors. It has HP Sure Start, a self-healing security protocol that restores a corrupted or attacked BIOS startup software.

HP ProDesk 600 G1
HP also has a tiny full-powered desktop computer that takes up less workspace than most office phones. The HP EliteDesk 800 G1 Business Desktop Mini is one of the industry’s smallest business desktops. It is integrated with the latest in power-efficiency, security, and manageability solutions. The volume of the desktop is just one liter. You can mount it on a wall, and it has an integrated wireless antenna. It is targeted at call centers, hospitals, retail, and healthcare. The machine has six USB ports, including a fast-charging port for tablets and smartphones. You can attach up to three displays via VGA or Display Port. It consumes less than eight watts of power at idle and uses Intel fourth-generation Core processors. It will be available in April for $669.
HP has also launched the HP ProDesk 600 G1 Business Desktop Mini, which is designed to keep users productive and IT operating costs down. The machine has HP’s Client Security portfolio, integrated wireless, and M.2 solid-state storage. It will be available in the U.S. in April at $489.

HP Classmate
And HP is unveiling the HP EliteDisplay S230tm, the company’s first Windows 8-certified multitouch monitor with an anti-glare treatment. It has a 23-inch diagonal multitouch monitor with antiglare glass for viewing in high ambient light conditions. It has a wide 178-degree viewing angle. It has integrated speakers, a 720p webcam, and dual microphones. The monitor supports high-definition resolution with In-Plane Switching (IPS) display technology. It will be available on Jan. 6 in the U.S. at $359.
In the education market, the company is launching the HP Classmate Notebook PC, which claims to offer students around the world the most immersive and rewarding educational experience available. The machine taps Intel’s Classmate PC reference design and runs Windows 8.1 with new Intel Celeron N2000 Series processors.
“Today’s business lifestyles continue to evolve at an incredible rate, resulting in a New Style of IT that requires stylish, easy-to-use devices coupled with expanding device security and manageability that can be used in a range of settings,” said Enrique Lores, senior vice president and general manager, Commercial PCs, HP. “HP addresses this new reality with a portfolio of high-impact business PCs and services that offer the ultimate in security and manageability, while still providing the style, lightness, and ease of use needed for all types of working environments.”
