PHILADELPHIA–(BUSINESS WIRE)–November 18, 2013–
Futura Mobility, a leading provider of mobile technology solutions and services to enterprise corporations and healthcare providers, was named to the Deloitte Technology Fast 500™ list, a prestigious recognition of the 500 fastest-growing technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences and clean technology companies in North America. Futura Mobility placed at No. 373 on the list.
This is the first time that Futura Mobility was named to the Fast 500, adding to an impressive awards resume that includes Hall of Fame honors in the Inc. 5000 and Philadelphia 100 . Earlier this year, Futura Mobility was also recognized as one of five “ Cool Vendors ” in Application Services by Gartner, Inc., a distinct recognition given to only a few hundred companies across 86 categories.
“It’s amazing how far we have come in such a short time,” said Janet DeNicola, Owner of Futura Mobility. “This honor illustrates our commitment to growth, and we continue to push the envelope for innovative solutions that meet our customer’s needs both today and into the future.”
Futura entered the healthcare market in 2007 as the exclusive service provider for Infologix, a Hatboro, PA based mobile solutions and services company founded in 2001 by Cosmo DeNicola and David Gulian, who served as CEO for 10 years until leading the acquisition and integration of Infologix and Stanley Black & Decker. In 2009, Futura branched out to provide mobile technology solutions, services and support directly to healthcare facilities under the name Futura Healthcare Technology. The acquisition of InfoLogix in the Spring of 2011 opened the door to re-unite the DeNicola team with Gulian. Before Gulian joined Futura Mobility as CEO in 2012, the company rebranded as Futura Mobility to better reflect its growing list of capabilities in healthcare and enterprise mobility. Under Gulian’s leadership, Futura has expanded the company’s portfolio to include telemedicine, chronic disease management, Real Time Location Systems (RTLS), and strategic consulting services.
“Just five years ago, Futura was primarily a behind-the scenes support and services provider,” reflects Gulian. “What differentiated the company was subject matter expertise in mobility in a time when mobile technologies were still fairly immature. Now, we have the opportunity to stand in front of both the customer and our partners and dictate what’s possible through mobility. We are just starting to scratch the surface.”
