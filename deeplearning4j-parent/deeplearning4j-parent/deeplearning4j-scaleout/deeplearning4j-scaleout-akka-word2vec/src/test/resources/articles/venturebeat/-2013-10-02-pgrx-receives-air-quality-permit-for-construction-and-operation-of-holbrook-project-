Permit Marks Major Project Milestone              Air Quality Permit is a Globally Recognized Mining Permit Required       for Construction
DENVER–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 2, 2013–
Prospect Global Resources Inc. (NASDAQ: PGRX) (“Prospect Global” or the       “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has received its Air Quality       Control Permit (“Air Permit”) for the construction and operation of an       underground potash mine and surface processing facilities from the       Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (“ADEQ”).
The mine and facilities are to be located approximately 30 miles       southeast of the city of Holbrook, AZ in Apache County.
The Air Permit is for the emissions from a 2.2 million ton per annum,       two train processing plant and related mine production as contemplated       by the Company’s Preliminary Economic Assessment completed in December       2011. Prospect Global is continuing to evaluate building only one of the       two processing trains and related mine output with correspondingly       reduced emissions as analyzed in the Company’s Pre-Feasibility Study.
The Company is on track to finish its infill drilling program over the       next two weeks and complete an updated 43-101 resource report by the end       of 2013.
