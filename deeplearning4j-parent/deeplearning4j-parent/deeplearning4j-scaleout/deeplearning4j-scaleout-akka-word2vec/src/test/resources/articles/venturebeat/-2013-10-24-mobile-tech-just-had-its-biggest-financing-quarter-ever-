Venture capitalists invested $1.12 billion to U.S. mobile companies in last quarter, making it the biggest venture capital financing quarter in history for this sector.
Q3 also had the highest number of mobile deals ever in a quarter, and it was the first time mobile VC deal share eclipsed the healthcare sector, according to a study by CB Insights. 
Mobile funding and deals have grown steadily over the past three quarters, with customer relationship management, business intelligence, and payment technologies attracting the most dollars.
500 Startups is the most active mobile investor so far in 2013, followed by Andreessen Horowitz, Google Ventures, SV Angel, and Qualcomm Ventures.
Mobile is at the forefront of every entrepreneur, corporation. and investors’ mind.
141 million people in the U.S. own smartphones and they are doing everything, from entering sales leads to shopping for new shoes, on them. Mobile devices are impacting just about every industry and vertical out there, driving engagement, sales, and causing businesses to come up with innovative business models that capitalize on this momentum.
Mobile makes up significant portions of the traffic for sites like LinkedIn, Facebook, Pinterest, and mobile advertising is expected to grow by over 300 percent to $40 billion by 2018. 
Along with consumer opportunities in media, healthcare, social networking, gaming, and commerce, enterprise organizations are also hopping on the mobile trend as more of their workers work using their smartphones. This also creates paves the way for security companies to build solutions that protect sensitive enterprise information, and productivity companies to help streamline mobile workflow.
Payments, of course, is also huge. Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and PayPal are locked in a battle to win the still-developing war for the mobile wallet, along with smaller companies like Square and Clinkle.
Then there are the opportunities for analytics, performance management,  and backend-as-a-service companies, like Flurry, Crittercism, and Parse.
And don’t get me started on whats happening with tablets.
I could go on and on about whats happening with mobile tech right now. We are in the midst of a mobile Renaissance, and entrepreneurs and investors are eager to profit off the innovation possibilities.
What is most exciting about mobile tech right now is not just the convenience of ordering a cab to your door or creating 6-second video masterpieces. It is the idea of plugging on otoscope into your phone and taking a medical-grade image of your childs’ ear for a doctor, or allowing a small business owner to accept money from their phone.
Its also that more people have access to mobile phones than toilets , and these 6 billion people represent a huge and far-reaching spectrum of opportunity.
Sure there are some stupid apps out there, like one that helps you find the nearest bar to watch football games, or the interminable parade of photo-sharing apps. But fundamentally what mobile does is bring anyone who can afford a phone online and create unprecedented access to the Internet economy.
As a side note, someone might want to get cracking on the toilet issue.
