Promotron to offer $100,000 to anyone who can hack their patented       technology during 30 day challenge
MIAMI–(BUSINESS WIRE)–December 20, 2013–
Promotron       Holdings Corporation , a Florida-based technology and licensing       company, today announced the launch of its Indiegogo       crowdfunding campaign to host a 30 day worldwide fraud challenge.       Unlike magnetic stripe, RFID, hologram and so-called “nano”       technologies, AtomIDTM is a first-of-its-kind particles-based solution with the ability to       “apply/store” data, inexpensively, onto a large variety of surfaces and       products; and with the unprecedented capability to “read” the data with       a low-cost reader at the point-of-sale or at any time.
“With the U.S. patents in place, we are ready to launch a 30 day Worldwide       Fraud Challenge , offering a $100,000 reward to anyone who can hack       or duplicate an AtomIDTM card that resembles a typical credit       card,” said Agustín Perez, inventor of the technology. The cards will       carry a secret identification code and will be widely distributed.       “AtomID is the only solution that can claim to be, unequivocally, 100       percent un-breachable.”
Promotron is inviting top laboratories, government agencies,       universities, major security companies and anyone interested, to attempt       to break into their secure data card. “It’s impossible and we can prove       it,” points out Mr. Perez. “The campaign slogan ‘This Will Make History       As Well,’ draws a parallel to the invention of the light bulb by Thomas       Edison – a game changer indeed – we envision a world that’s free of       credit card fraud, identity theft, pharmaceutical and all types of       counterfeiting.”
About AtomIDTM
Based on quantum physics and inspired by string-theory science, the       patented AtomIDTM technology revolves around the development       of tiny three-dimensional atomic structures, carrying information called       “Datablocks.” Any attempt to tamper or otherwise “open” a Datablock,       renders the signal invalid. The impossibility of scanning and/or in any       way duplicating the exact three-dimensional atomic structure of each       Datablock, applied in any given item being protected, makes AtomIDTM the only solution that can make the 100 percent tamper-proof claim.
With the cost of identity theft, fraud and counterfeiting reaching       epidemic proportions, governments, banks, luxury brands and       pharmaceutical companies are just some of the targets identified by       Promotron. “We can also apply the technology to cellular phones or any       type of electronic device, and even online data transmissions can be       delivered safely using AtomIDTM,” remarked Perez.
Live Web Conference Demonstration Planned
Promotron will host a live web conference demonstration of the       technology on February 6, 2014, at 1 pm EST. The media, private and       public entities, as well as the public are invited to register and       participate at http://promotroncorp.com/accreditation.html
