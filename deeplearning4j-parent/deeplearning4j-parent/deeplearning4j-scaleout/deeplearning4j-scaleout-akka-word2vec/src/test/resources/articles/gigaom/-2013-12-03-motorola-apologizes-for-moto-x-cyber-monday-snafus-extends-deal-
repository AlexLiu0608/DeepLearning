After a Cyber Monday meltdown that prevented customers from buying a Moto X smartphone at $150 off, Motorola is both apologizing and extending the deal for two additional days.

Claiming it wasn’t ready for the high volume of orders on discounted Moto X handsets on Monday morning, Motorola apologized later that same evening for the hours of customer frustration . A blog post from Motorola CEO Dennis Woodside offered the apology, detailing the issues Motorola faced on Cyber Monday when it offered $150 off no-contract versions of the Moto X smartphone.
Woodside said demand was far higher than anticipated and that pre-sale testing wasn’t robust enough to test high volumes of traffic on the Motorola website. A fix is being implemented and Motorola is actually giving customers — and itself — a pair of do-overs:
“Here is what we are going to do: Starting at 12 pm EST/9 am PST this Wednesday, we will relaunch the $349 promotion. To help make up for this major inconvenience to shoppers, we will also add an additional promotional day on Monday, December 9. We will double the quantity of phones available, while supplies last, to allow as many people as possible to take advantage of the promotion. We’re also extending the 30% off offer on accessories to these two days. “
There’s no doubt many would-be customers were completely turned off by the Cyber Monday experience; I saw dozens of very upset folks posting about the problem on various social networks. Some are sure to ignore the extended promotion. But I think a larger number of those will still try to pounce on the deal both on Wednesday and next Monday.
Because of that, and the fact that Motorola is doubling the limited supply of discounted phones, I suspect the company will end up selling more Moto X handsets than it would have had the Cyber Monday deal gone smoothly. Make no mistake though: as “a Google company”, Motorola should be on the hook going forward to keep its web servers up and running.
