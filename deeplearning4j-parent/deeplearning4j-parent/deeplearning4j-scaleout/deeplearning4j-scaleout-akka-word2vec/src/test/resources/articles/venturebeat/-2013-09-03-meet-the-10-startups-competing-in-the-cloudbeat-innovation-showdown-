We were blown away by the quality of the 200 plus cloud startup applicants to the CloudBeat 2013 Innovation Showdown , one of the highlights of VentureBeat’s third annual cloud adoption event (Sept. 9-Sept. 10 in San Francisco).
We’ve narrowed the pool down to 10 finalists, who will present their innovative cloud app or product live on day two of CloudBeat. This year we’ve broken the finalists into two groups: Early stage companies (late seed stage to Series A) and midstage companies (Series A to Series B funding).
They’ll each have 5 minutes to sell our expert panel of judges on how their company embodies, enables, or amplifies the very best new ideas in and around the cloud.
Judges include:
Ping Li, partner, Accel Partners
Deepak Jeevan Kumar, principal, General Catalyst
Robert Abbott, general partner, Norwest Venture Partners
Ross Fubini, partner, Canaan Partners
Matt Ocko, comanaging partner, Data Collective
Jai Das, managing director, SAP Ventures
Todd Rumberger, partner, Foley & Lardner LLP
