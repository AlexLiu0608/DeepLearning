Tidemark , a vendor of cloud-based applications for businesses to get a handle on employees, finances, and profitability, has raised just over $1 million more in funding, according to a filing the company submitted yesterday to the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission.
The form, published on the SEC’s site today, does not disclose new investors. It does name existing backers of the company, including Workday co-chief executive Aneel Bhusri, Redpoint Ventures partner Geoff Yang, and Ben Horowitz, a cofounder of Andreessen Horowitz.
The new funding comes about five months after news of Tidemark’s $13 million round . In the six months leading up to that, the company had brought on 50 customers. Current customers include Brown University, Chuck E. Cheese’s, HubSpot, and Pabst Brewing Company, according to Tidemark’s website.
The company prides itself on delivering easy-to-use mobile applications, not just desktop programs.
Including the new funding, Tidemark has taken on at least $49 million.
The company did not respond to a request for comment.
