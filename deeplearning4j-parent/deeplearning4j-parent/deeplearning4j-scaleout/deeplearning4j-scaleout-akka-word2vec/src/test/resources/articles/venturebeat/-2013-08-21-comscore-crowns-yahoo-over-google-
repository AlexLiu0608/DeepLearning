Yahoo beat Google for the first time in years as the highest ranked U.S. web property by unique vistors, according to today’s ComScore rankings .
This news was brought to our attention by Marketing Land , which also reported that Yahoo hasn’t been number one for a while. Google took over the top spot in May 2011 and has remained there ever since.
All the press and hype around Yahoo appears to be paying off.
In addition, Yahoo has released more products in the past six months than it has in years. It’s aggressively hiring, and the company has made quite a few strategic acquisitions of mobile and media startups.
Yahoo’s largest buy-up?  Tumblr , the micro-blogging platform, which has also staged a bit of a comeback in recent months. Yahoo and Tumblr’s traffic figures have not yet been combined, but when they are, expect Yahoo to get another bump.
This month, Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer grabbed yet more headlines after being featured on the front cover of Vogue. In one of her first in-depth interviews since taking the reigns at Yahoo, Mayer stressed that product comes first.
“I just want to make sure it’s user-experience positive,” she told Vogue.
