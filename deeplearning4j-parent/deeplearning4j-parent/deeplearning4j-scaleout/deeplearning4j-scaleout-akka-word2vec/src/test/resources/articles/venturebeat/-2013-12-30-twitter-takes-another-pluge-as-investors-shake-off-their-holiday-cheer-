Whatever holiday goodwill investors had toward Twitter last week is all but gone this morning.
Twitter’s shares have dropped as low as $58.91 today, marking an unsavory end to a week that saw the stock hit an all-time high of $74.73. The news caps off a rough pair of trading days for Twitter, which lost over $5 billion from its market capitalization on Friday alone .
That drop, like today’s, is the result of a few less-than-positive takes from investors as of late. While Twitter’s stock is priced at three times its $26 IPO price, many investors just don’t think Twitter — which is still unprofitable —  has justified its valuation. And they’re punishing the company in turn.
Merry Christmas, Twitter!
Still, for Twitter stalwarts, there’s a lot of reason to be optimistic. The last month of the year brought a number of promising initiatives from the company, including its own ad retargeting effort and plans to  bring promoted accounts to the streams of mobile users . We’ll see which take proves to be the right one as Twitter moves into 2014.
