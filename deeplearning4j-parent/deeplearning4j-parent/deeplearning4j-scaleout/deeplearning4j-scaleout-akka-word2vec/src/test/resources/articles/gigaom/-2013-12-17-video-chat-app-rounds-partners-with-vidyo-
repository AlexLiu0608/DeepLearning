Rounds , the group video chat app we’ve covered a few times before on Gigaom , announced a partnership with Vidyo Tuesday. Rounds will use Vidyo’s technology to power the next generation of its mobile app, which will include features like video overlays while you browse a site or watch a YouTube video — think chatheads, but with live vide feeds. The company is working on this new app now, and a spokesperson told me it will be ready for release within about a month.
