Whoops! Someone over at Google sure has butterfingers. (Or more likely, Google is sneaky like a fox.)
Just like that “accidental” glimpse at the Nexus 5 in an Android promo photo , Google “mistakenly” flipped the switch to make its next Nexus model briefly viewable on its Google Play store last night, Engadget reports . And I’m sure all the buzz from hungry gadget blogs and Android fans just couldn’t be helped.
So what’s new? The Nexus 5 looks slightly larger than last year’s Nexus 4, but it forgoes the glitsy rear back cover for a matte finish. It doesn’t appear to be particularly thin (the Nexus 4 was also kind of chunky), and there aren’t any big cosmetic improvements from what I can tell (not surprising from an LG-built smartphone).
Most of the Nexus 5′s improvements will be internal: A leaked service manual revealed it sports an updated quad-core Snapdragon processor, a 5-inch screen, and an improved camera. (And yes, I’m sure that manual look was a complete fluke as well).
The Google Play listing priced the Nexus 5 at $349 for the 16 gigabyte model, slightly higher than what the Nexus 4 launched with last year. While it looks fairly unremarkable, the Nexus 5 continues Google’s new territory for the Nexus line: Offering powerful, unlocked hardware at a surprisingly affordable price.
