I’ve been waiting to tell y’all about this for months: We’re hosting a developer conference this fall, and it’s unlike anything you’ve ever seen.
If you’ve already heard enough and are ready to mark your calendars, the event is called DevBeat . It’s taking place November 12-13, 2013 in San Francisco, and you should get an earlybird-priced ticket now.
Here’s why you want to come: It’s two days of hands-on experiences with the best companies and the best hackers in the world. No panels, no fluff, no filler. No one onstage without a deep technical background.
We will be doing presentations, live Ask Me Anything sessions, and lots of Q&A. It’ll be fun, interactive, and most importantly, extremely useful. We’ll be delving into a huge breadth of topics, not just one technology or one company’s technologies.
And we have a whole track of the conference just to teach you new ways to code. We’re offering Master Classes to teach you the basics and practical applications of technologies like Erlang, Scala, Python, and Node.js — the kind of thing you’ve wanted to hack around with for ages but haven’t found the time to learn just yet.
Of course there will be a hackathon, too. But I imagine you’re as bored with typical build-an-app-overnight hackathons as I am. So we’re doing a hardware hackathon with our friends at Upverter with the generous sponsorship of Ford. For two days, you and your new best friends will be soldering and prototyping your hearts out.
There’s so much more to tell you — we’re doing a security “breakathon.” We’ve got speakers who will blow your mind and make all your hacker-y dreams come true. We booked a huge, gothy-goth mansion with three floors of historical darkness. As a nice bonus, we’ve got an insane musical guest lined up. If you want to know more — or pre-register for the hackathon and/or Master Classes — check out the DevBeat 2013 event page . And pass along the good news to a dev you know!
We’ll be announcing more about DevBeat, including specific speakers, shortly, so stay tuned.
VentureBeat is creating an index of the most exciting cloud-based services for developers . Take a look at our initial suggestions and  complete the survey  to help us build a definitive index. We’ll publish the official index later this month, and for those who fill out surveys, we’ll send you an expanded report free of charge.  Speak with the analyst who put this survey together to get more in-depth information,  inquire within .
