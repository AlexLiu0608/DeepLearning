Spotify is holding a press event in New York City next week, and according to sources familiar the matter speaking to both the Wall Street Journal and TechCrunch , it is to introduce a free mobile music service. That’s in stark contrast to what the streaming music provider offers now, which requires users to sign up for its $10 monthly premium service in order to access mobile streaming.
According to the reports, Spotify has secured deals with Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group. Free mobile streaming will be ad-supported, and allow users to play a limited number of songs on demand. Mostly, though, the app will serve up customized stations, much like Pandora and iTunes Radio do.
Right now Spotify users can play ad-supported music on demand from their computers, so this will bring a similar feature to the mobile experience. Spotify’s event takes place on December 11, so we’ll know for sure soon enough.
