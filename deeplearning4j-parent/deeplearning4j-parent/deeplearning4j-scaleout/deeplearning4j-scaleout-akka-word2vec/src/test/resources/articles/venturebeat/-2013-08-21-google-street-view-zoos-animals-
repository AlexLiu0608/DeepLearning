The Internet is already essentially owned by cats . Now some more exotic animals will get a little love thanks to Google Street View.
Google said today that its Street View application in Google Maps will now feature views inside zoos around the world.
Zoos included in this new Street View collection are from North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Cities represented include San Diego, Houston, Atlanta, and Chicago in the United States. International locales represented include Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Germany, Spain, France, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
Animals you can view via Street View include panda bears, red pandas, tigers, lions, polar bears, penguins, ducks, flamingos, and more.
