One of the best parts about Nokia’s recent PureView phones is the new Nokia Camera app, which brings together a number of automatic settings, as well as features from the Pro Camera and Smart Camera apps. Better yet, though, is that you no longer need a PureView phone to use the app. Nokia is making the new Camera app available to all Lumia phones running Windows Phone 8 as part of a Nokia Beta Labs trial.
According to Nokia, the app won’t look any different from the current Nokia Camera app to start. But over time new features will be added to the beta app and tested before they reach the official app in the Windows Phone store. As such, some of these new features may not be completely stable until all of the kinks are worked out.
Beta issues aside, this is great news, as it should ultimately improve the camera experience for all Lumia owners with a compatible handset. And in my opinion, it doesn’t diminish the PureView brand, as those phones already come equipped with more powerful cameras to start.
So if you’re looking to get a taste of the new features sooner than later, simply head to the Beta Labs site  and sign up. The app supports the Lumia 520, Lumia 521, Lumia 620, Lumia 625, Lumia 720, Lumia 810, Lumia 820, and Lumia 822. You’ll need to have the Lumia Amber or Lumia Black software update installed in order to use the app.
