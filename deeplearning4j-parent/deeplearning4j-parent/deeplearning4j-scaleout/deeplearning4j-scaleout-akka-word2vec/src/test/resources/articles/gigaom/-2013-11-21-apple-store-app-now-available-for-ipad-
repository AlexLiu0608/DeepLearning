No longer must iPad users suffer the cruel indignity of browsing the Apple Store through their Web browser, or worse yet, a grotesquely enlarged iPhone app. Apple has introduced an iPad-optimized Apple Store app, just in time for the holiday shopping season.
Exclusive to the iPad app is a “Now Trending” section, which shows popular items based on what people are buying, reviewing and sharing via social media. There’s also a map view that shows  physical Apple store locations, on top of which you can view availability information.
Other than that, there isn’t much here you won’t find online or on the iPhone app. It’s all rather beautiful, though, borrowing heavily from iOS 7’s sleek, minimalist design language. Also worth mentioning is that the app is available in the U.S. only for now. So if you have an iPad and you’re looking to buy more from Apple, the 22MB app is worth a download.
