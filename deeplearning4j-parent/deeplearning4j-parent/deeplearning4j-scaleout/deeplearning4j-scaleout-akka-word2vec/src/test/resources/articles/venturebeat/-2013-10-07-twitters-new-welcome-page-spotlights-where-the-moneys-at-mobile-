With the Twitter IPO all lined up, the company updated its welcome page this weekend to better represent the company’s focus for the near future: the mobile space.
The new web page design centers on mobile devices, with prominent links to the iOS and Android Twitter apps.
With 65 percent of Twitter’s ad sales coming from mobile platforms, it’s not a huge surprise the company wants more users to tweet on the go. Twitter called mobile “the primary driver of our business” in its S-1 documentation for its IPO .
“We expect that the proportion of active users on, and advertising revenue generated from, mobile devices, will continue to grow in the near term,” reads the intro to the filing.
But that’s not the only change to the welcome screen, which also features updated copy: “Start a conversation, explore your interests, and be in the know,” it reads.
Unlike the old welcome screen, which told users to “find out what’s happening, right now,” this new description tells people how to actually use Twitter, albeit briefly (the company’s forte).
A Twitter representative declined to comment on its new welcome page.
