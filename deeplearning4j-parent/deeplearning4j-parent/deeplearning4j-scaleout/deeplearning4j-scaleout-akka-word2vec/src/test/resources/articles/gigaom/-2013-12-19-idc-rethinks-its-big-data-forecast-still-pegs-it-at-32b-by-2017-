IDC has released its forecast for the big data market and predicts it will grow to $32.4 billion by 2017, at a compound annual growth rate of 27 percent. The fastest-growing segment will be cloud infrastructure, which IDC predicts will grow at 49 percent per year. Last year, IDC predicted a $23.8 billion market by 2016 at a CAGR of 31.7 percent. It also predicted the storage would be the fastest-growing segment at 53.4 percent. The research firm acknowledges the changes and attributes them (and other changes in methodology) to fluidity in a new, fast-moving market â€” a fair point and a smart decision if the company wants its forecast to remain relevant.
