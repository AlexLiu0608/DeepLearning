Here’s some exciting news for you uber-nerd developers out there: Google’s Tim Bray is speaking at DevBeat, our first-ever developer conference next month !
Who is this Tim Bray, you ask? Well, for starters, he’s one of the original authors of XML — a fact that chapped Microsoft’s royal behind quite severely back in the nineties. Here’s the tale, as told by Wikipedia :
As an Invited Expert at the World Wide Web Consortium between 1996 and 1999, Bray co-edited the XML and XML namespace specifications. Halfway through the project Bray accepted a consulting engagement with Netscape, provoking vociferous protests from Netscape competitor Microsoft (who had supported the initial moves to bring SGML to the web.) Bray was temporarily asked to resign the editorship. This led to intense dispute in the Working Group, eventually solved by the appointment of Microsoft’s Jean Paoli as third co-editor.
Developer drama: It’s not just for Ruby fanfolk.
At DevBeat, Tim will be giving a lovely talk about identity and security for the modern developer. You won’t want to miss it.
For our inaugural speaker lineup , we’ve worked hard to get speakers you can really respect, opinionated hackers with fascinating talks, and industry veterans with a lifetime’s worth of career experience to share. We’ve also lined up a slate of Master Classes, where you can learn entirely new technologies or explore the finer points of languages you already know.
Seriously, y’all, this is a killer show we’re putting on. Do get tickets soon (and don’t forget to expense them). The conference is filling up fast with developers of all kinds, and we don’t want you to miss out!
Thanks to the following industry leaders for supporting DevBeat: Ford and Pivotal as Platinum Partners; IBM as Gold Partner; and PayPal as Silver Partner.
