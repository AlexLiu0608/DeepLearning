Proving that large businesses no longer need to manage racks of hardware just to have their own phone service, cloud communications provider Thinking Phone Networks has nabbed even more funding.
The company announced today that it has raised $10 million in a follow to its third funding round, led by Bessemer Venture Partners and Advanced Technology Ventures. Altogether, Thinking Phone Networks has raised more than $30 million.
Like most cloud service providers, the company basically lets businesses offload something that used to be very difficult to the cloud. Thinking Phone Networks’ provides voice service, video and audio conferencing, analytics capabilities, and more, without having to deal with servers and other complicated hardware.
The company also offers business intelligence capabilities, enabling customers to get a clear view of how their employees are operating, and bring-your-own-device support for iOS and Android devices. With its “ThinkingMobile” apps, employees can access other business data from Thinking Phone Networks’ enterprise apps.
