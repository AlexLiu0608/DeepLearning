This repainting job will lead to the extinction of the human race.
The constant thrumming of an air compressor, the shouts of working men, the stomp of heavy boots high on the scaffolding, the insistent scraping of metal against wood — on and on, day after day, our lives become a shadowy filmstrip running over the unending soundtrack of urban rebirth.
It will begin in our house: our HOA president will snap and turn into a rage-infused zombie. And then, as in all zombie cases, the heat and fury will overflow and infect each and every one of us — a sea of construction-bred zombies plaguing San Francisco, ripping out orange extension cords and crushing no-parking signs. And we won’t stop until every jackhammer has been silenced.
But we haven’t snapped yet, so here’s a bunch of funding briefs.
