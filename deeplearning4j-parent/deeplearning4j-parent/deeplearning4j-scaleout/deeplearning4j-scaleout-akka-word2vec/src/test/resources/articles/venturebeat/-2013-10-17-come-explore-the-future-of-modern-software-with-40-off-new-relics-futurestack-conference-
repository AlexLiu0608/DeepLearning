New Relic, the San Francisco-based leader in Software Analytics, is set to host their inaugural  FutureStack  conference in just one week from today. On Oct. 24-Oct. 25, the  Grand Hyatt San Francisco  will be transformed by the sounds of 800-plus disruptive developers, technologists, and creatives, joining together to imagine, build, and craft the future of modern software.
The conference is packed with tracks focused on innovation, talks led by industry thought-leaders from the likes of Microsoft,  Twitter, and Pandora, and even a concert by legendary rock band, Cake. FutureStack’s 40-plus sessions are dedicated to exploring data, hardware, and creative-engineering cultures, and New Relic hopes the conference will give attendees the opportunity to help define, debate, and build a better future through software innovation.
New Relic’s very own coding CEO, Lew Cirne, will kick-off the multitrack, two-day affair, with his highly anticipated “State of the Future” keynote. Additional  speakers  include leaders from tech companies at the forefront of innovation such as Amazon, GitHub, Google, Microsoft Azure, RackSpace, and more.
