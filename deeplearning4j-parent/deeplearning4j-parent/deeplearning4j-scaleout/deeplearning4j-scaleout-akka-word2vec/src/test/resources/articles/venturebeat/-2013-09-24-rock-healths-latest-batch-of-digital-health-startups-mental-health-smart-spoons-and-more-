SAN FRANCISCO – At  Rock Health , entrepreneurs are developing innovative products to keep us healthier, and lower medical care costs.
Ten health startups in Rock Health’s current accelerator class presented to a roomful of investors and the press today. Rock Health is a startup accelerator that focuses on health care technology.
The current class of startups are tackling huge challenges in health care, such as cancer treatment or eating disorders.
Interest in digital health — and Rock Health startups — is surging , as evidenced by the number of venture capitalists in the room. At demo day, I spotted investors from venture firms like Aberdare,  Morgenthaler (now Canvas), Emergence Capital and General Catalyst .
As you might expect, the wearable technology startups garnered plenty of interest — a respiration tracker called Spire has been trending on AngelList all week. We frequently heard terms like “big data” and “data science” during the presentations — most of the founders had a strong engineering background. For instance, one Rock Health startup, Anapsis, was founded by a distributed systems engineer at Microsoft.
The ban on general solicitation was lifted this week, meaning that startups can publicly announce that they are fundraising . Investors can fund Rock Health’s startups on AngelList . According to Rock Health, the current class pulled in $5.5 million in funding before Demo Day. Many of the startups announced that they have already closed a seed round of funding. Others are still looking to fill out their round.
Here’s the full list of startups that launched today.
