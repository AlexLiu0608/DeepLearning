Android Device Manager, Googleâ€™s answer to Find My iPhone , is now available to download from Google Play . Introduced back in August but only available on the Web until now, you can install the app on any device running Android 2.3 or later. The software lets you locate a missing device on a map, make a phone ring to help you find it, and remotely lock or erase a device if necessary. Google is still just playing catch up with this one, but better late than never.
