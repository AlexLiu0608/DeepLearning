# Motivating examples

## Named-entity recognition

One use of deep-learning networks is [named-entity recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition), which is a way to extract from unstructured, unlabeled data certain types of information like people, places, companies or things. That information can then be stored in a structured schema to build, say, a list of addresses or serve as a benchmark for an identity validation engine. 

## Object Recognition

Object recognition is the ability to identify arbitrary objects in text such as balls, animals, or even faces. This is typically used in engineering applications to identify shapes for modeling purposes. This is also used by social networks for tagging of photos.

## Speech to Text

A deep network is capable of understanding audio signals with the right data transforms. This can be used in identifying individual snippets of sound in audio files.
