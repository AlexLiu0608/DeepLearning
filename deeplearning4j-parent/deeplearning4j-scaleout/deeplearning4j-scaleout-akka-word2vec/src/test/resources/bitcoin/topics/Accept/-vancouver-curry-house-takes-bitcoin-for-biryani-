Bitcoin’s move to the mainstream just got serious – you can now exchange your virtual coins for an actual, real world curry.
Admittedly you’ll need to be in Canada, but it’s still epoch-defining news. Indian Gate Restaurant and Bar in Vancouver will host a Bitcoin meet-up this week on Wednesday and becomes the world’s first curry house to take the alternative currency.
The curry house gets a respectable 3.5 stars on Urbanspoon and the menu has all the
British
Indian classics from lamb biryani to chicken tikka massala.
The Vancouver BTC group claims 133 members so it could be a busy night.
There’s a full list of bitcoin-accepting businesses on Reddit here.
