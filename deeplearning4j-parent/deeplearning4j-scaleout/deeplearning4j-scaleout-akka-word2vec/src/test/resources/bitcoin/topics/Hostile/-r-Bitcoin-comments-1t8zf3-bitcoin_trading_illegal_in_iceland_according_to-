The following is a rough translation from the business page of Iceland's most prominent newspaper. http://www.mbl.is/vidskipti/frettir/2013/12/19/hoftin_stodva_vidskipti_med_bitcoin/
Capital controls stop Bitcoin trading
It is prohibited to engage in foreign exchange trading with the electronic currency Bitcoin, according to the Icelandic Foreign Exchange Act. A written response from the Central Bank of Iceland to Morgunblaðið states that the Foreign Exchange Act specifies general restrictions on foreign exchange trading and capital movements between countries. "It does not appear that the provisions of the Act that exempt goods and services from the aforementioned restrictions can be applied to trading in Bitcoin or that other exemptions from restrictions of the Act apply to such transactions," the Central Banks's response states.
The electronic Currency Bitcoin has made the headlines in recent weeks due to a sharp rise in the currency's value. At it's peak at the end of last month the Bitcoin exchange rate reached over 1,200 dollars. Since then it's value has depreceated considerably and now a Bitcoin costs around 875 dollars.
EDIT:
This does not mean Bitcoin is illegal.
Mining is legal
Owning bitcoin is legal (as of yet)
Selling goods and services for bitcoin is legal
It is however illegal, according to the Central Bank, to buy bitcoins with fiat.
