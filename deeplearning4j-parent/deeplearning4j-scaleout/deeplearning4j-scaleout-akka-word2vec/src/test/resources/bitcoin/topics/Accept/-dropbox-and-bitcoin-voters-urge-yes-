Marriage made in heaven?
Fans of Dropbox and Bitcoin are eagerly pushing for the companies to get together.
It was in late summer of 2011 when a user of Dropbox’s Votebox suggestion feature first urged the company to let customers buy storage with bitcoins . Last week, the suggestion still had just around 3,500 upvotes.
Since then, however, a campaign some are calling the Dropbox Bitcoin Project has managed to persuade thousands of bitcoin fans to voice their support on Dropbox. As of mid-day (CST) Wednesday, users had submitted more than 102,000 upvotes for the suggestion, pushing the proposal to Votebox’s front page.
(It helps that Dropbox users get nine votes per month and can use all of them on a single suggestion. Even so, the results indicate that well over 10,000 bitcoin supporters have joined the call for BTC-enabled cloud storage.)
“I love dropbox and btc,” user Alexander T. offered on the Votebox page. “I’d love them even much (sic) together!”
“Bitcoin is ubiquitous internet currency,” added Dan M. “Dropbox is ubiquitous storage. Perfect complements.”
CoinDesk contacted Dropbox for comment, but had not received a response as of presstime. Unlike, say, the White House petition site , Dropbox doesn’t specify a minimum Votebox participation level that would trigger a required response from the company.
