The Blender Foundation, which is behind the free and open-source 3D computer graphics program Blender , has joined the community of websites that accept bitcoin donations. While not much fanfare accompanied the decision, Blender’s website now features a bitcoin address — 17orEh51ab8HoU7g8Ezwcp76jCpeL7PabJ — for supporters who want to throw a bit of digital currency its way.
“Amazing!” wrote reddit user Annihilia. “I’m a huge proponent of Blender. Easily one of my most used tools for work.”
“Excellent to see,” added redditor AD-Edge. “I’m a long time user of Blender. When I get some BTC of my own, I’ll have to throw some their way.”
As of press time, according to Blockchain.info , the Blender Foundation had received a total of 0.4894 bitcoins — around $53.64 — in donations.
First released in 1995, the Blender software can be used for 3D modeling, animation, video editing and more. It also features a built-in game engine. The software has been used to help create such movies as Spider-Man 2 and The Secret of Kells, along with several “Open Movie” projects by the Blender Foundation.
The Blender Foundation is led by Ton Roosendaal , Blender’s initial author. The organization is based in Amsterdam.
