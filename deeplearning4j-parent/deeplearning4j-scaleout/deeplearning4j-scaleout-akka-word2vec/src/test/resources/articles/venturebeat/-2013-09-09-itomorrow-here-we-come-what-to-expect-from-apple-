New iPhones and a new iPhone operating system are pretty much guaranteed for tomorrow. Now we’re going to get a little bit speculative.
Apple knows that it’s in trouble, has been losing market share, and that it needs to demonstrate that Cupertino is still the global nexus for cutting-edge mobile device design — something that’s very much in doubt right now. The very invitation for this Apple Event says that “this should brighten everyone’s day.”
So Apple just might go all out – like it did last year — and pull the wraps off a whole lot of iGoodness.
iTunes Radio, OS X, new Macs
Black lipstick, anyone?
iTunes Radio hasn’t actually launched yet, but the media deals appear to be in place. Expect something about this Pandora competitor. Also, a new version of Apple’s desktop operating system, OS X Mavericks, is in the works, and Apple might just decided to mention something about it, like a launch date. And finally, the first new Mac Pro in years , which Apple teased in the summer, is due to make a public appearance sometime soon.
As for new iPods … who really cares?
iPads
Apple typically doesn’t release new iPads at the same event as iPhones. But with iPad market share starting to tumble at the same time as iPhone, Apple might just decide to “think different” and come out with a unified front of new smartphone and tablet devices. There’s been a lot of speculation and rumor lately about new iPad Minis, a new generation of iPads that are as thin as the Mini iPads, and more.
This is not terribly likely, but it is possible.
And finally … one more thing … iWatch
Could it, could it, could it be possible that Apple might finally unveil a wearable computing product, such as iWatch.

An iWatch prototype
Samsung beat it to the punch with the ugly and limited Galaxy Gear , beating Apple to the punch . As if that’s not bad enough, a car company — yes, a car company; you can’t get more old-school than that — just launched an absolutely gorgeous new smartwatch that looks like it might have been designed by a drooling Apple fanboy on a pirated Photoshop bender.
So Apple has some catching up to do.
Apple never releases anything until it’s ready, however, and despite the long rumor cycle on this one, there are no guarantees.
