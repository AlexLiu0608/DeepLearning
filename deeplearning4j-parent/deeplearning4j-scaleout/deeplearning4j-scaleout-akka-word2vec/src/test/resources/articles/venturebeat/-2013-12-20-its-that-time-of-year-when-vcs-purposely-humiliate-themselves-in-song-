Oh, First Round Capital. You’ve made a holiday tradition of taking the year’s weirdest memes and crafting them into bizarrely well-produced, startup-themed music videos.
And we’ve made a holiday tradition of sharing them with our readers to spread the holiday cringing.

It’s what we would do if we had all that money, too. Great minds, huh?
