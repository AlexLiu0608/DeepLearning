Batman Multiverse-1a
“With a new form of storytelling, we wanted to make sure we used the right property, and I think we’ve found that with Batman,” DC Entertainment SVP Hank Kanalz said in an interview with VentureBeat.”The audience of Arkham Origins fans are the right fit [to debut] Multiverse books.”
But perhaps the biggest selling point is that you get multiple stories out of a single book, and not every story path will have the same ending, as I previously speculated .
“When we do the demo for the first chapter, it takes us about 45 minutes, and that’s with us zipping through,” Kanalz added.
That’s a heck of a deal when you consider that an average comic takes about 20 minutes to read and costs $3 to $5 on average. The first chapter of the Arkham Origins Multiverse book, by comparison, gives you more than double the amount of entertainment time and costs $0.99. Subsequent chapters will cost $2, but you also have the option of buying a “season pass” for $15, which will also provide you with two new skins (aka in-game content) for the Arkham Origins video game.
Multiverse books also use Madefire’s technology for optimizing a comic page for touch screen devices, allowing objects to move around using the device’s accelerometer, or having certain elements on the page appear animated. The Arkham Origins Multiverse series will also feature the same soundtrack as its video game counterpart.
Supercharging DC’s line of ‘digital first’ comic series with Madefire tech
DC’s Madefire partnership doesn’t end with the Multiverse books. The company is also debuting an enhanced, motion book version of its Injustice digital comic book series that will be made available for sale within Madefire’s iOS apps and the deviantART web store alongside Hellboy , Star Trek, and Transformers motion books.
The company also plans to start producing future digital first comics within Madefire the same day they go on sale in other digital stores, such as ComiXology, Amazon’s Kindle Store, and more — AND the Madefire versions will sell for the same $0.99 price. So, not only is this a big win for fans of motion books, but also for Madefire.
