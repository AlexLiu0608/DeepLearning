As we reach the end of the year, it’s time to reflect on the things we think are important.
And if Facebook is any indication, we care most about the Pope, elections, and a tiny, royal human.
The world’s largest social network shared some statistics with us Monday morning revealing what people on Facebook talked about most this year. The undeniably hip Pope Francis snagged the top spot as the most discussed topic worldwide — although in the U.S., we mentioned the Super Bowl, the government shutdown, and the Boston Marathon more.
Another popular topic was Nelson Mandela, the South African emancipator and president who died Thursday at age 95. Around 55 million people had over 115 million interactions on Facebook related to the passing of Mandela, who worked throughout his life to bring democracy to a country torn by crime, corruption, and racism.
In the U.S., Daft Punk’s hit Get Lucky proved the most popular song, racking up the most Spotify plays through Facebook. And the most referenced technology was Instagram (and its squarish photos), which Facebook snapped up last year for $1 billion .
Facebook also shared some usage stats with VentureBeat. The social network had an average 727 million daily active users in Sept. 2013, roughly 80 percent of which are from outside the U.S. and Canada. And a ton of those users are transitioning to mobile devices: Facebook had 874 million monthly active users on mobile as of Sept. 30.
