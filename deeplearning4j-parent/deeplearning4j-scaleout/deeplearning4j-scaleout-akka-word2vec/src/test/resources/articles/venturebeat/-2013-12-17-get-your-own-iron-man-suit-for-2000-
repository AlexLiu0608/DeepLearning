If you’re like most people, you don’t have a billion or so dollars laying around to spend on developing a real life Iron Man suit as worn by superhero Tony Stark of comic book and movie fame. And if you’re like me in particular, you’re sick of waiting on Elon Musk to build one. (Geez is he lazy.)
Fortunately thanks to a new crowdfunding campaign that launched today, you can have the next best thing: A suit that looks and feels exactly like the Iron Man Mark III armor worn by Robert Downy Jr. in the movies. (Basically, it’s a costume.)
The suit is crafted from 3D printed parts and features metal joints, a helmet that slides up to reveal your face, and even an LED-powered fake arc reactor embedded in the chest plate. (For non geeks, that’s the artificial glowing heart.) It’ll set you back $2,000, which would be worth it for the ultimate Iron Man fan.
The crowdfunding campaign, launched by Iron Man Factory , said it will take about 6 to 8 months after it reaches about 5,000 orders to send out your ridiculously cool Iron Man costume. However, those who don’t want to wait that long can order a 3D printed version (not assembled) that will arrive between 3 to 4 months after the company reaches its campaign pledge goal.
The biggest problem I see is that I didn’t find an official Marvel endorsement stamp anywhere on the page. I’d hate to get charged the $2,000 asking price only to learn that Marvel/Disney lawyers have shut down the project after it gets funded. (I tweeted Marvel’s inside man Agent M to see if Iron Man Factory has their consent.)
Check out the crowdfunding campaign’s video embedded below for a closer look at the replica Iron Man suit.
