The teardown is a savvy move, because it highlights the PS4′s upgradeability (you can also upgrade the PS3 with off-the-shelf hard drives), its high-end specs, and the elegance of its design.
It also makes it clear, to hardcore gamers, how much the PS4 has in common with a high-end PC gaming rig, right down the x86 processor, and the flashy heat sink and copper heat pipes.
Wired published this video of Yasuhiro Ootori, the director of the engineering department at Sony Computer Entertainment, taking apart his new device. After about 30 seconds of unboxing, Ootori gets right down to the business of disassembling the PlayStation 4.
Just four screws hold together its outer casing, making repairs and upgrades easy. The catch: These screws are hidden underneath an external seal, which you have to peel off before you can access them. That means if someone has opened the case, you’ll be able to tell — whether you’re an individual buying a second-hand PS4 or a Sony repair rep trying to assess whether a console might be nonfunctioning due to user error.
* We say that lovingly. Actually, we love iFixit and look forward to seeing what repairability score it gives the PlayStation 4 when it comes out.
Correction 10:30 a.m. Pacific: The PS4 has 8GB of memory distributed across 16 GDDR5 modules, not 16GB.
