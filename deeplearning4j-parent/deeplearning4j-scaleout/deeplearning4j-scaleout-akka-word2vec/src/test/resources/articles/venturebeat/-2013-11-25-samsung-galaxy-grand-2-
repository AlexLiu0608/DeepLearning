Go big or go home.
That’s the message we’re hearing from electronics giant Samsung, which today unveiled another oversized Android device to add to its large-screen smartphone lineup, the Galaxy Grand 2.
The Grand 2 is more of a mid-tier smartphone than Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S4 or Note 3 devices, but it’s larger than its predecessor, sporting a 5.25-inch HD display (1280 x 720) with a 16:9 aspect ratio. It’s more powerful, too, housing a quad-core 1.2GHz processor, 1.5GB RAM, and a 2,600 mAh battery (that’ll net 17 hours of talk time on a single charge, according to Samsung).The rear-facing camera is still 8-megapixels, though.
Internal storage is just 8GB out of the box, but you can toss in a microSD card for up to 64GB of space. The phone’s dual-SIM capability lets you switch between different carriers, but the Galaxy Grand 2 isn’t 4G LTE-compatible (it supports HSPA+ instead).
Because using one app at a time is clearly insufficient, the Galaxy Grand 2 has a multi-window feature that takes advantage of the device’s large screen to run two apps side-by-side. (But seriously, this feature could be pretty handy for navigation or relaying information to a friend via text.)
The Galaxy Grand 2 is equipped with Android 4.3. When it launches, it’ll come in white, black, and pink, but Samsung didn’t reveal specific launch dates, market availability, or pricing details. We’ve reached out to Samsung for more details, so we’ll be sure to keep you updated when we learn more.
Samsung posted a record $9.56 billion profit last quarter, outpacing even its own predictions. Some analysts are concerned the high-end smartphone market is reaching saturation, however, which would affect Samsung’s bottom line going forward.
