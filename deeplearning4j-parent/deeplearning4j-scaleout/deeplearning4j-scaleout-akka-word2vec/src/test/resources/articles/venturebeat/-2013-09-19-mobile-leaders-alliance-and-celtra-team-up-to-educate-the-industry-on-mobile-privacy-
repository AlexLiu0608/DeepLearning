Discussions to follow with such industry luminaries as Jaka Jancar (Celtra), Stuart Ingis (Venable LLC), Alan Chapell (Chapell & Associates), and Liz Ross (BPN).
MLA and Celtra joined forces to bring this event to life with the shared belief that education is the key to unlocking mobile’s true future. “The privacy discussion is so huge right now in mobile. It’s more important than ever to stay in front of this topic and ensure you, and your company, are up to speed on the latest standards and regulations,” MLA Founder Dan Wittmers said. MLA and Celtra thank all the sponsors and participants that helped bring A Morning of Mobile Privacy together.
