Company Benefits from Array Biopharma’s Multi-year Discovery Effort;       Licenses Diverse Chemical Matter that Selectively Inhibits the Trk       Family While Sparing Off-targets Such as JAK, ALK and VEGF              One of Company’s Compounds Featured in Scientific Paper Published       Online in Nature Medicine on October 27
NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 28, 2013–
Loxo Oncology, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on targeted       cancer therapies for genetically-defined populations, announced today       that its lead clinical program is a potent and selective inhibitor of       the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Loxo Oncology acquired       rights to this program from Array Biopharma (NASDAQ:ARRY), which had       pursued a multi-year discovery effort to design purpose-built compounds       that spare structurally similar kinase targets, such as ALK, JAK and       VEGF.
“After years of debate, it seems clear that highly specific kinase       inhibitors have won the day in oncology,” said Keith Flaherty, M.D.,       director of the Henri and Belinda Termeer Center for Targeted Therapies       at Massachusetts General Hospital and chair of Loxo Oncology’s       Scientific Advisory Board. “We have learned that maximal target       inhibition leads to measurably better clinical outcomes. Limitations of       dose, because of off-target mediated toxicity, prevent us from realizing       the full therapeutic potential of a target. We were fortunate to have       access to chemical matter rationally designed to inhibit Trk to maximal       effect in patients”
Loxo Oncology’s lead candidate has been optimized to preserve low       nanomolar potency in both enzymatic and cell based assays, while       demonstrating compelling pharmacology through oral dosing. The company       remains on track to launch its Phase 1 study in 2014.
Research suggests that Trk has therapeutic potential in many tumor       types. In a recent article, “Oncogenic and drug-sensitive NTRK1       rearrangements in lung cancer,” published online in Nature Medicine,       Doebele and colleagues describe new findings implicating Trk in lung       cancer. The work includes results showing potent growth inhibition with       one of the many Trk inhibitors licensed to Loxo Oncology in cell lines       harboring a translocation, or rearrangement, of Trk. Several other       translocations, including ALK, ROS1 and RET, have been studied as       oncogenic drivers in lung cancer and have been associated with robust       objective response rates in the clinic.
About Loxo Oncology
Loxo Oncology was incorporated in Delaware in May 2013 and was founded       by Josh Bilenker, M.D., a partner at Aisling Capital. Loxo Oncology is committed to bringing targeted cancer therapies rapidly into the clinic       that have an opportunity for outsized clinical effects in       genetically-defined patient populations. The company signed a       multi-target, multi-year collaboration agreement with Array Biopharma       (NASDAQ:ARRY) wherein the companies will collaborate to bring drugs       through preclinical development. Loxo Oncology is responsible for       clinical development and commercialization. Loxo Oncology derives its       company name from an attendant of the Greek goddess Artemis, who       represented the concept of trajectory in the sport of archery.
