Redbox Instant added support for Airplay on Apple TV set-top box today, joining a handful of other top movie services.
The feature addition comes with an update to Redbox Instant’s iOS app , which adds support for Airplay for all devices running iOS 6 and up. You still won’t be able to download movies to watch when an Internet connection isn’t available, and you’ll have to navigate back to the movie you’re watching whenever you receive a notification interruption, including those that cause you to navigate away from the app itself.
Redbox Instant isn’t free, however, and still requires you to sign up for a monthly service plan that offers you a number of streaming movie rentals as well as tokens to redeem at Redbox vending machines in your area.
It’s nice to see that Redbox Instant is supporting Airplay, but I can’t help think that the rush to support mirror screen technology has something to do with added competition from Google’s Chromecast . Either way, it means a more enjoyable second-screen viewing experience for all of us.
