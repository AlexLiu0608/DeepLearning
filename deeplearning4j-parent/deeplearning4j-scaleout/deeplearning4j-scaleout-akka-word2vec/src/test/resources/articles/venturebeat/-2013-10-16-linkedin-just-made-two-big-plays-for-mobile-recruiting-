With two new mobile products , LinkedIn has become a lot more useful for recruiters and companies looking to promote open positions.
Today, the social network for professionals  unveiled Recruiter Mobile , an iPhone app for members of its premium Recruiter service that tracks candidates and gets feedback from hiring managers. LinkedIn also announced Mobile Work With Us, an upgrade of an existing service that promotes jobs on a company employee’s mobile LinkedIn profiles.
Both moves make sense for LinkedIn (and frankly, I’m surprised they’re just being announced now) as the company refocuses on ways to take advantage of its unique position as a trusted professional tool. Instead of just being a place you occasionally visit to update your digital resume, it’s trying to attract regular visitors with customer content and tapping into its valuable profile data with services like Recruiter.
“About 33 percent of members visit LinkedIn from mobile. Plus, more than 30 percent of LinkedIn job views come from mobile and half of members who’ve applied via mobile for jobs posted on LinkedIn have never applied from their desktop,” writes Parker Barrile, LinkedIn’s senior director of product, in a blog post today.
Both of the new features are available to customers of LinkedIn’s existing Recruiter and Work With Us services.
