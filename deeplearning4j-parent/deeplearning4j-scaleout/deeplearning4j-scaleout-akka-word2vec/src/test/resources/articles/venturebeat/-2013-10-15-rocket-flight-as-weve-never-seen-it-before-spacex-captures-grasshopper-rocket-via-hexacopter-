In some video frames, you can clearly see one side of the hexacopter, as well as its blades. In others, you can see that the hexacopter is incredibly close to the SpaceX Grasshopper rocket’s flight path — just a few degrees off.
That’s possible because that hexacopters are cheap, light machines that do not pose any danger to the rocket. They allow close-up photography of hard-to-reach places without any risk to human life either. Frankly, at SpaceX’s scale of R&D, these hexacopters are almost disposable.
And they give us literally a birds-eye view of some of the most advanced rocketry in the world today.
SpaceX is experimenting with multiple methods of retrieving expensive rocket components, either by survivable splashdowns in the ocean, as with the powerful Falcon 9 rocket , or by landing rockets on their tails.
