Company announces the Skulpt Aim™ – 2014 CES Innovations Honoree for       Health and Fitness, revolutionizing the way we measure body composition
DAVIE, Fla.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–November 13, 2013–
Skulpt, a leading technology developer that empowers people to better       understand their bodies, unveiled today the first-ever device to measure       muscle fitness. The Skulpt Aim is the world’s only wireless device able       to accurately measure individual muscles’ fat percentage and muscle       quality. It was recognized with the 2014 International CES Innovations       Design and Engineering Awards Honoree title in the Health and Fitness       product category. The earliest adopters can pre-order the device       starting at $99 through Skulpt’s 60-day crowd-funding campaign on       Indiegogo ( www.skulpt.me/preorder ).       After the campaign, it will be available for $149.

THE TECHNOLOGY: Aim changes the way we measure body composition. It       measures how current flows through individual muscles to evaluate their       quality and fat percentage. Aim’s proprietary sensors collect thousands       of data points, converting them to precise metrics that recognize even       the slightest improvements. This technology has already been proven in       the nation’s top hospitals. Now Skulpt makes it available to consumers.
THE DEVICE: Smaller than an iPhone, the glossy, portable Aim was       designed to fit comfortably in your palm as it hugs your muscles. It’s       strong and water-resistant.
THE EXPERIENCE: Press Aim to any major muscle for immediate feedback.       Results are displayed instantly and wirelessly synced to a personal       online dashboard. Track progress over time, set goals, and share with       friends.
“Aim is beautifully designed and unique in its ability to target       individual areas,” says Jose Bohorquez, CEO of Skulpt. “People often       gain weight when they first start to exercise and get discouraged when       in fact they’re losing fat and gaining muscle. Aim solves this problem       by distinguishing muscle from fat in each part of your body, providing a       much more accurate representation of your progress.”
