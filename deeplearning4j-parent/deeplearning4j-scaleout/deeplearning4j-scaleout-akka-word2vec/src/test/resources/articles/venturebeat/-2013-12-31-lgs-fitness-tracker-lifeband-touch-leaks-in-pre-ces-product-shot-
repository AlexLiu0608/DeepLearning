LG’s latest take on the fitness tracker is here, and it looks a little familiar.
Dubbed the “LG Lifeband Touch,” the device has made an early appearance ahead of this year’s Consumer Electronics Show,  courtesy of prolific leaker Evleaks .
While we know next to nothing about the device, we do know this: Assuming the render is legit, LG has clearly taken a few design cues from the Nike Fuelband, which the Lifeband Touch could easily be confused with.
Looks a little familiar…
The form factor isn’t new for LG. At last year’s CES, the company teased the Smart Activity Tracker , a similar device that LG had pegged for a summer release. Despite its promise, the device never materialized.
Evleaks has a pretty good track record with these sorts of leaks, having been the source of early shots of devices like the Moto X , the Nokia Lumia 1520 , and the  Nexus 7 refresh . So there’s not much reason to be too skeptical here.
