There’s big money in virtual keyboards these days.
After announcing its second funding round of $17.5 million in September , hot Android keyboard company SwiftKey announced today that Accel Partners will also be participating in that round. SwiftKey previously noted that Index Ventures led that funding round, with participation by Octopus Investments.
The company’s alternative Android keyboard ($3.99) is one of the most popular on Google’s platform, thanks to its predictive selections and its ability to quickly learn your typing habits. SwiftKey can also tap into your Gmail, Twitter, Facebook, and blog content to train itself on your written voice. The company is also one of the few firms out there managing to make a decent profit from an app on Google Play.
As part of Accel Partner’s investment, SwiftKey co-founders Jon Reynolds and Ben Medlock note that they’ll be working closely with Rich Wong, one of the firm’s general partners. “He brings a wealth of experience in building transformative mobile businesses so it’s great to have Rich involved as we accelerate our plans at SwiftKey,” they said.
SwiftKey is based in London and has now raised over $21 million in total.
