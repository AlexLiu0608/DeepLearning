Did you know that running a startup in Zurich versus San Francisco can cost you a whole person’s salary more?
Or that hiring a developer in Mumbai is 15 percent cheaper than if you were hiring one in Syndey?
While startup entrepreneurs are often obsessed with product and building out a great team, location can be a huge financial factor to consider. Staff.com looked at what it would cost to build a startup of two web developers, one designer, and an office space in Zurich, Sydney, New York, San Francisco, London, Paris, Mumbai, and Manilla. The cost differences are huge.
You have to factor in the expected pay rate for developers in designers in each country — almost more so than how much the real estate costs will be. Developers in Zurich expect to be paid a handsome $99,120 a year, whereas a San Francisco developer might demand nearly $20,000 less.
And though Paris seems like one of the most expensive places in the world, it’ll cost you nearly $100,000 less to run your company there than New York (which will run you upwards of $296,592 annually).
