At this point in the mobile Internet’s evolution, you’d think it would be relatively painless to send attached files through your native email client on iOS. In reality it’s not, but touch gesture-based iOS email client Boxer has remedied this problem.
Boxer, formerly called Taskbox , lets you scan through a busy email inbox on your iPhone in a fraction of the time it would take you to sift through it on the desktop. Email messages become tasks that can be assigned a level of priority, and you can even set up a number of canned responses to close discussion threads.
Today Boxer is rolling out integration with cloud-based storage service Box , which lets you add file attachments to email messages in the same way you add photos, videos, or contacts using Apple’s native Mail app or even Google’s Gmail app — neither of which offers support for attachments.
“Our main goal with Boxer is to speed up the process of getting through your inbox while on your phone. Not being able to send a file attachment can really slow you down, which is why we’re excited about the Box integration,” said Boxer CEO and cofounder Andrew Eye in an interview with VentureBeat.
Boxer is a paid app that will set you back $3.99 in the iOS App Store , but that isn’t necessarily the startup’s only source of revenue. Boxer will also gain some revenue through Box.net’s partner program, which pays its partners for how much activity they drive to Box’s cloud-storage service.
Founded in 2012, Austin, Texas-based Boxer has raised $600,000 in funding  and is planning to bring its file attachment feature to other cloud-based storage services, such as Apple’s iCloud and Google Drive. Boxer already offers support for Box competitor Dropbox, too.
