YouTube isn’t the only Google product capable of looking back fondly on a year’s worth of content . The people in charge of Google Play are doing something similar for the most popular games and apps on the Android market.

To celebrate the end of 2013, the company had its customers vote to determine the most addictive title, the best movie-licensed title, and more on Google Play. Check out all the winners:
Most addictive game: Knights & Dragons (Gree)
Best franchise game: Bejeweled Blitz (Electronic Arts)
Best app for enhancing the everyday: Duolingo: Learn Languages Free (Duolingo)
Best app for booking and buying: Flixster (Flixster, Inc.)
Best Google app: YouTube (Google)
Knights & Dragons is a free-to-play action role-playing game. It has players going on quests to defeat enemies and collect loot while building up a kingdom.
