MusicGraph semantically connects over a billion facts according to a       rich music ontology that can be leveraged by users as well as developers
MIAMI–(BUSINESS WIRE)–December 4, 2013–
Senzari® today announced MusicGraph, the world’s first knowledge engine for       music, which will be available as a consumer app across most major       mobile platforms, as well as a powerful “graph API” that can be       leveraged by developers to enhance their applications with deep musical       intelligence. MusicGraph contains over a billion facts that have been       organized into a rich music ontology, which includes acoustical and       lyrical features, detailed artist, album and song information, as well       hundreds of other data points related user preferences.
“We are very excited to unveil MusicGraph, which constitutes over two       years of our work,” explained Demian Bellumio, COO of Senzari. “It all       started when we were looking for a music recommendation engine to       license for our own music service, and we found the few market       alternatives to be very limiting in terms of data and features – all       meant to build a Pandora clone. But even more frustrating was the       onerous licensing structure, whereby you not only need to give up part       of your business, but also have no real visibility into what is going on       under the hood,” added Bellumio.
MusicGraph leverages the latest and most advanced “graph computing” and       “Big Data” technologies to create large, distributed graphs, which       contain detailed information of over twenty million songs, and are       connected to millions of individual albums and artists across all       genres. The information includes proprietary data generated via feature       extraction from the music, like tempo, chord progression, and key, as       well as lyrical data, such as ‘bag-of-words’ and concept extractions       derived from lyrics.
The consumer version of MusicGraph has first been launched on the       Firefox OS platform in order to support Senzari partner, Mozilla in       development of this initiative. MusicGraph puts the world’s music       knowledge at the fingertips of all Firefox OS users. MusicGraph will be       expanded to iOS, Android and Windows Mobile users in the coming weeks.       With the app users will be able to ask the service very detailed       questions about the music they love, for example: “Who are artists that       are similar to Coldplay that were born in Manchester and are male?”
The MusicGraph API is available under a “developer” model, which is free       of charge, as well as a commercial licensing model. There are three core       components of the API: the playlist generator, graph search and data       access. The playlist generator allows for the creation of playlists       based on Senzari’s proprietary graph algorithms that can personalize and       contextualize each recommendation based on a variety of signals.       Furthermore, each song recommendation comes with “evidence” that details       why the song was chosen, providing an unparalleled level transparency       when compared to other solutions in the market. The graph search       component allows developers to incorporate Senzari’s deep musical       knowledge into their apps and search engines. And lastly, Senzari’s data       access component provides a number of low-level features extracted from       the songs that developers and scientists can leverage to optimize their       own music analysis or to develop new novel algorithms on top of it.
“We are excited to see how the market responds to our approach, as such       a level of data access has not been common in the music space,”       commented Bill Hajjar, CEO of Senzari. “More importantly, we are pricing       our API starting at $499 and increasing based on usage, which is at       least ten times lower than market alternatives. This model allows our       partners to clearly understand how their costs will scale, like they do       with other components of their infrastructure, such as AWS and other       cloud services.”
The MusicGraph apps will be accessible at musicgraph.com and developers       can learn more about the API at developer.musicgraph.com.
