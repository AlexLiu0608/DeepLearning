If you purchase, evaluate, develop, or invest in enterprise technology, CloudBeat is where you need to be.
Now in its third year, our highly-acclaimed enterprise cloud event will track the growing maturity of the sector through two days of case studies, breakout sessions, and exclusive announcements.
It’s all happening Sept. 9-10 in San Francisco.
Unlike nearly all other cloud events, the customers themselves are front and center. Their discussions with vendors and other experts unearth rare lessons on cloud adoption, providing insights and actionable data on new technologies, what really works, who’s buying what, and where the industry is going.
This year we’ve got brand-new case studies from Netflix, NASA, PayPal, General Electric, IBM, Stanford University, and Optimizely, to name a few.
Today we’re announcing leading execs from Firebase, Adobe, and Box.
See what they’ll be digging into at CloudBeat below, and make sure to grab your tickets !
James Tamplin, Founder & CEO, Firebase
James Tamplin will illustrate how Firebase enables developers to apply their core skills at developing apps as they can trust Firebase to handle a previously tedious setup of backend and servers. In an era of maturity for the cloud, most of the layers of the stack can be managed by third parties that will do the job better, faster and cheaper, allowing specialized developers to come up with great applications without having to reinvent the wheel.
Sam Schillace, VP of Engineering, Box
Sam Schillace will touch upon the challenges and opportunities of the growing API economy. Like Box, more and more companies are providing tools for developers to build applications on top of their platforms, some even evolve into marketplaces where apps connect to dozens of online services and streams. It’s critical for any business to get the business and the technical aspects of its API strategy right, to develop and scale their relationships within their ecosystems faster than ever before.
Dave Lenoe, Product Security Director, Adobe
Dave is responsible for the Security of the various Adobe products. As his company is catching the tide and shifting its offering from desktop software to cloud-based solutions, Dave is carefully accompanying the transition to a new ecosystem, with new rules, and the same stringent requirements. As the apps are made flexible and connected so users can access them from more locations and devices, developers have to adapt and bake security always more early into the design. Come learn how securing a cloud app may not be as similar as securing legacy enterprise apps as your CIO might expect.
