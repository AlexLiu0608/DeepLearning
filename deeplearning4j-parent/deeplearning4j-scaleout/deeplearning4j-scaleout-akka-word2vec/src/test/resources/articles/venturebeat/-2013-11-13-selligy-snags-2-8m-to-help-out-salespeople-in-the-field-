Selligy , a customer relationship management (CRM) app for iPhone, aims to make salespeople more effective by automating much of the sales process.
And Salesforce.com, the CRM giant, appears to like it.
Belmont, Calif.-based Selligy just raised a $2.8 million funding round led by Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ) with participation from Salesforce, Alchemist Accelerator, and several angel investors. The startup will use the fund injection – its first major raise – to bring its app to other mobile devices, including the iPad and Android devices; integrate the service with additional CRM systems beyond Salesforce; and market Selligy Enterprise, a revamped version of the service that launched today.
Salesforce often invests in CRM category leaders — especially those that integrate well with its platform — but so far it hasn’t made too many bets on the mobile space. “So when [Salesforce] saw our product, they immediately said to us, ‘we’d like to invest,’” said Nilay Patel, Selligy’s cofounder and CEO, in an interview.
Selligy taps into your contacts, calendar, and even location data and integrates that info with Salesforce’s Sales Cloud. So Selligy will know when you walk out of a meeting, ping you with a few quick questions, and automatically pipe that data back to the right places.
“Our design goal is literally to have the salesperson update how their meeting went in the time it takes to ride an elevator,” Selligy’s director of marketing and business development, Chris van Loben Sels, told VentureBeat.
Selligy is focused on enterprise accounts, thus the “Selligy Enterprise” branding, although it could be used by smaller businesses. The list price for the software is $35 per user per month, with additional tiers based on usage.
Selligy currently has five employees but intends to hire more following this financing. DFJ investor Josh Stein, who previously invested in Box and SugarCRM, will join Selligy’s board of directors.
