The fifth HTML5DevConf  – the world’s largest web, hybrid app and mobile web conference for developers and designers — will be held at the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco on October 22 and October 23. Join us for leading edge sessions and separate one day training classes . (Note: There’s limited availability on classes as many are full are almost full.)
Both Adobe and Intel, among others leaders, are planning product technology announcements at the conference.
HTML5 and related technology families — JavaScript, CSS3, Node.js, and WebGL — now dominate development on the web and mobile web. Even more interesting, and of course controversial, is the growing emergence HTML5 as the choice for approximately 50 percent of app developers, according to Forrester. That’s a big jump from 2010, when almost all apps were native. But the trend marches on: Gartner postulates that by 2016, hybrid (wrapped HTML5) apps will be split fifty-fifty with native apps on the consumer side, while hybrid apps will dominate app development in the enterprise.
Join us, and we’ll help you stay up to date on a clearly important and evolving technology family.
In addition, the On Android Developers Conference is launching in the same venue. It’s an Android-focused event by the same organizers as HTML5DevCon. On Android concentrates on developers, both native and HTML5, with an emphasis on the world’s most popular mobile operating system. Check out the session speakers and one day classes for everything On Android.
Whether you are an HTML5 cross-platform developer or a strictly Android developer or designer, we look forward to seeing you there!
