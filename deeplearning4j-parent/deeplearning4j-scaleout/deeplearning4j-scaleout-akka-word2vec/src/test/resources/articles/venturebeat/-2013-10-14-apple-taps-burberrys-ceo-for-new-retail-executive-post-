Angela Ahrendts
Apple has hired Angela Ahrendts, chief executive of traditional fashion retailer Burberry, as the new head of its online and retail stores.
Ahrendts will report directly to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Ahrendts will oversee the strategic direction, expansion, and operation of both Apple retail and online stores, which have drawn hundreds of millions of consumers from around the globe. You can bet that this means that Apple plans to shake up its retail presence and stay on the cutting edge of selling.
“I am thrilled that Angela will be joining our team,” said Cook in a statement. “She shares our values and our focus on innovation, and she places the same strong emphasis as we do on the customer experience. She has shown herself to be an extraordinary leader throughout her career and has a proven track record.”
Ahrendts will join Apple in the spring.
“I am profoundly honored to join Apple in this newly created position next year, and very much look forward to working with the global teams to further enrich the consumer experience on and offline,” said Ahrendts. “I have always admired the innovation and impact Apple products and services have on people’s lives and hope in some small way I can help contribute to the company’s continued success and leadership in changing the world.”
Prior to Burberry, Ahrendts was executive vice president at Liz Claiborne, and she also previously served as president of Donna Karan International. Burberry said that its chief creative officer Christopher Bailey would become CEO, replacing Ahrendts.
Burberry made $1.1 billion in revenues in the past six months. Apple makes about half of that in a day.
