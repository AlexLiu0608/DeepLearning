Past winners have raised $100-plus million in follow-on funding. Past winners include Thumbtack, Udemy, PokitDok, DogVacay, and more. The investor judges on stage are: Tony Conrad (True Ventures), Sean Flynn (Shasta Ventures), Howard Hartenbaum (August Capital), Charles Hudson (SoftTech VC), Jed Katz (Javelin Venture Partners), Lars Leckie (Hummer Winblad), Charles Moldow (Foundation Capital), Rick Moss (Hub Ventures), Bambi Francisco (Vator), Dave Samuel (Freestyle), Jenny Fielding (BBC Worldwide Ventures), Shanna Tellerman (Google Ventures), and Kristian Segerstrale (Initial Capital).
To get onstage, you have to win an online competition and then a judges’ competition. But it’s free, and it’s worth a shot. Even those who enter get exposure just for entering.
