Hewlett-Packard chief Meg Whitman said in an analyst conference call today that convertible laptop-tablet hybrids are a key category for HP’s advertising during the holidays. But she said it remains to be seen how well the company will do with its entries in this competitive but innovative area of the PC business.
Convertibles such as HP’s EliteBook Revolve 810 model [above] can work both as laptops and, once you twist the screen and lay it flat, as tablets. A host of competitors from Asus to Sony have launched hybrids, which have also been pushed heavily by Microsoft and Intel as innovations that set PCs apart from Android and iOS devices.
“I think it’s hard too early to tell how the demand for convertibles is going, whether it’s in the commercial space or consumer space,” Whitman said. “We’ve got a lot of convertibles in the market and so do our competitors. We’ll know after we get through the Christmas season.”
The devices fit with Whitman’s overall strategy for HP of focusing on areas where HP can win and deliver disruptive solutions to the market. Whitman said that HP is advertising the convertibles front and center in its ads because they are innovative and offer the best of laptops and the best of tablets.
