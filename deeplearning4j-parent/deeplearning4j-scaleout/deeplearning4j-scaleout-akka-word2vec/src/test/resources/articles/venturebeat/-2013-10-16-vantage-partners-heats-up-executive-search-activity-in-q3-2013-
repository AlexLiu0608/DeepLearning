SAN MATEO, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 16, 2013–
Vantage Partners LLC, a leading retained executive search firm in       Silicon Valley, announces a successful third quarter of 2013 with       completions of executive searches for clients ranging from early stage       venture-funded to billion dollar publicly held companies. With continued       high growth in Q3, Vantage Partners leads the executive search industry       across the fastest-growing markets including Enterprise (Big       Data/Analytics, SaaS, Cloud, Mobile and Security), Consumer, Internet,       Digital Media and Ad Technology. In Q3, Vantage Partners observed an       increase in key executive hires in core products, development and       strategy roles. Also, record amounts of venture funding are being       invested in Mobile/Consumer enterprises. With this new funding comes       pressure from investors to engage and recruit the top echelon of executives.
In other observations, as the Ad Technology industry evolves, companies       are repositioning themselves in the big data and analytics quadrant.       This growing trend impacts the executive search process as more ad       technology companies compete for talent in enterprise software markets.       Companies report that finding and recruiting executive talent remains a       key competitive advantage, but it is increasingly more difficult to       accomplish without a search firm that has deep experience and track       record in their industries. Engaging and recruiting executives from       enterprise companies, however, into newer consumer oriented markets is       an initiative that Vantage Partners has been able to achieve       successfully for many clients.
Notable wins for Vantage Partners in Q3 include completion of VP       Products, VP Engineering, VP Sales, VP Professional Services and VP       Analytics searches for Yahoo, OpenX, Tagged, Ellie Mae, LiquidSpace,       Yummly, Acxiom, Tyrian Systems and others.
Landing top executive talent to achieve transformational results remains       a critical driving factor of many searches. With mission-critical       searches, Vantage continues to deliver impactful executive talent to       enable successful outcomes for clients across several technology sectors.
