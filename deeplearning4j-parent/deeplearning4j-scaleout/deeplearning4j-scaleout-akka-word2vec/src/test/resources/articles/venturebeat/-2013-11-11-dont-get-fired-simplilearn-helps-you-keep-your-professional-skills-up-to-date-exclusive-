Blink. You missed it. Your skill set may now be obsolete.  
Simplilearn wants to help employees keep up with the fast-moving, competitive professional world. The online training and certification provider released a mobile application today and announced a partnership with Udemy .
Simplilearn claims to be the world’s largest certification training provider for working professionals. It offers a mix of classroom and online courses that help people get accreditations and approvals for skill sets they need for their career.
Now its 80 certification courses are available on both smartphones and feature phones. CEO Krishna Kumar said the goal is to make the services more accessible to professionals around the world. Two-thirds of the world’s population uses feature phones , and so Simplilearn built a mobile web platform, rather than native smartphone apps.
The days when people can learn one skill and nourish it over the course of their career are quickly fading. The churning pace of technology means you constantly have to learn new things to keep your skill set up to date. A degree or certification received 10 years ago is probably not relevant anymore. Employees want to keep their existing jobs, and employers want to remain competitive without replacing their workforce every time the IT landscape moves forward.
This is where Simplilearn steps in.
Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) are playing a major role in making education more accessible. These large educational portals feature videos and content on a wide variety of subjects, ranging from Ancient Greek history to introductory classes on coding in Python.
Simplilearns’ niche is corporate certification. Categories include project management, agile and scrum certification, IT service management, big data and cloud computing, IT security management, finance management, quality management, SAP certification, CompTIA certification, Microsoft certification, and Cisco.
Through the partnership with Udemy, Simplilearn’s project management professional training will be available to all Udemy users.
Udemy is one of the most well-known MOOCs on the market. More than one million students use the site to watch video and live lectures from hundreds of expert instructors.  The company launched a series of corporate training tools in April to help companies train their employees.
Some people take online courses for the pleasure of learning, but a majority have a specific career goal in mind. MOOCs have to offer professional value to the students if they hope to stay relevant, and companies like Udemy, Coursera, and Udacity are working to get their courses approved for college credit or culminate in formal certification.
Simplilearn took a different approach, by targeting businesses as its clients rather than individuals. This partnership with Udemy will give more people the ability to take its courses, and Udemy will add more Simplilearn courses in the coming months. It also underscores Udemy’s efforts at making its content more actionable in the real world.
Simplilearn also unveiled its Authorized Training Program today, which works with small- and medium-sized training providers to offer their courses to a wider global audience. The company said it trains about 4,000 professionals a month and has trained 75,000 people since its launch.
