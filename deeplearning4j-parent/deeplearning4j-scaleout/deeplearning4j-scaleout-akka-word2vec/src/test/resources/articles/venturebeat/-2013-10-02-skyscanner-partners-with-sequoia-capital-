Sequoia Capital’s investment values Skyscanner at $800M              Sir Michael Moritz joins Skyscanner’s Board
EDINBURGH, Scotland–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 3, 2013–
Skyscanner , the world’s fastest       growing international travel search company, today announced that it has       partnered with Sequoia Capital .       Sir Michael Moritz will represent Sequoia on Skyscanner’s Board of       Directors.
Sequoia Capital’s secondary investment values Skyscanner at $800m       and will give the company access to a deep pool of experience at a time       when the company is undergoing a period of rapid, self-funded growth.       It’s one of the largest investments in any company Sequoia Capital has       made to date. Scottish Equity Partners remains the company’s largest       investor, providing its expertise as one of Europe’s top venture capital       firms.
Skyscanner has grown more than 100% year on year for the past four       years. It more than doubled its staff last year and will double staff       again to 500 over the next year. Its mobile app has been downloaded over       25 million times and its web site attracts over 25 million unique users       a month. Skyscanner has just opened a new office in Miami as a base from       which to build its business in the US, Canadian and Latin American       markets. It is already showing triple digit growth elsewhere around the       world.
Gareth Williams, Skyscanner’s Chief Executive Officer, commented:       “Sequoia Capital’s investment in Skyscanner brings us a depth of       experience drawn from a pantheon of tech brands. We want to provide       comprehensive and inspiring answers to travellers worldwide for all       aspects of their trips. We intend to offer our users more of the great       technology and functionality they’re already familiar with.”
Michael Moritz, Chairman of Sequoia Capital, said: “Much remains to be       done to make mobile and online travel easier for consumers from Accra to       Zagreb and Skyscanner is paving these paths. Skyscanner’s success in       helping people find the world’s most accurate flight information is just       the beginning of what’s possible. Skyscanner is one of the best       technology companies ever to come out of Europe and is already a leading       global player. Our job is to help take its current success a step       further. Founders and CEOs like Skyscanner’s Gareth Williams are part of       an extremely rare species with talents that most of us yearn for but       don’t possess.”
Calum Paterson, Managing Partner at Scottish Equity Partners, who is       also a member of the Skyscanner Board of Directors, said: ”We have       worked closely with Skyscanner since we first invested almost six years       ago. During that time it has achieved exponential growth and been       transformed into a world class company. It’s a privilege to work with       such an outstanding team and to play a part in their remarkable journey.       We are pleased to welcome Sequoia Capital and Michael Moritz and we look       forward to their contribution as we look to help Skyscanner achieve even       greater success in the future.”
Today’s news comes on the back of a recent acquisition by Skyscanner of Fogg ,       a Barcelona-based company that makes internet hotel search simpler and       faster. The acquisition was a significant step in Skyscanner’s strategy       of expanding its travel offering into other important areas of its       users’ travel plans. Skyscanner’s comprehensive, proprietary flight       search product has already demonstrated its appeal to consumers around       the world. It has launched a powerful proprietary car rental engine also       built from the ground-up.
