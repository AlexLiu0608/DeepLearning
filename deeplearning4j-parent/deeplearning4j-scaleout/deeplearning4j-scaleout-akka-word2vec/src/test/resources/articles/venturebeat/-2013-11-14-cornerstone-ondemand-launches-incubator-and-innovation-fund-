Strategic initiative created to invest in, advise and collaborate       with promising cloud startups that support Cornerstone’s market expansion
SANTA MONICA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–November 14, 2013–
Cornerstone       OnDemand (NASDAQ: CSOD), a global leader in cloud-based talent       management software solutions, today announced the launch of the Cornerstone       Innovation Fund , a strategic initiative created to invest in, advise       and collaborate with promising cloud startups building innovative       business applications that support the continued expansion of       Cornerstone’s market reach.
Cornerstone’s vision is to foster the development of a comprehensive       ecosystem of cutting-edge solutions for organizations seeking to       differentiate and continuously evolve their talent management       strategies. In addition, the fund gives Cornerstone an opportunity to       support the burgeoning Los Angeles technology community, as well as       other technology communities throughout the world.
Through the fund, Cornerstone anticipates making a few strategic       investments each year, with each individual investment ranging from $250       thousand to $1 million in size. All investments will be approved by       Cornerstone’s board of directors and will be made alongside select       leading venture capital firms.
Cornerstone will also allow young companies to apply for use of a       dedicated creative work space within its Santa Monica, Calif.       headquarters, giving them direct access to the experience and expertise       of the Cornerstone OnDemand team. In addition to supporting external       ventures, Cornerstone also plans to use this space to rotate small,       cross-functional teams of its own employees to create new applications       or feature sets built on the Cornerstone platform, as well as cultivate       new company initiatives as it did with its Cornerstone       for Salesforce application.
