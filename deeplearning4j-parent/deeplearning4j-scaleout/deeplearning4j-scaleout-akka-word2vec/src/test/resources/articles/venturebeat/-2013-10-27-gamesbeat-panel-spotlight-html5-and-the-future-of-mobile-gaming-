The mobile industry has been buzzing with HTML5 for a few years now, but the new lingua franca for the web has been hampered by a lack of supporting technologies, operating systems, and silicon. However, new developments on many fronts have started to make HTML5 more attractive, and the future is showing that this technology has a bright future.

Greg Ovalle, CEO of Stealth
In the past, the web format has been too slow for use in fast-action games. But as the ecosystem around it grows, HTML5 could become the future for multiplatform games, the web, mobile, TV, and the connected automobile.
We’ll kick this engaging subject around in a panel at our  GamesBeat 2013  conference. Moderated by Greg Ovalle, the chief executive officer of Stealth, the panel includes Iker Jamardo Zugaza, the vice president of engineering at Ludei; Marcus Kruger, the chairman at Goo Technologies; and Neil Trevett, the vice president at Nvidia.
The event is Oct. 29-Oct. 30 at the Sofitel Hotel in Redwood City, Calif.

We’ve entered the Battle Royal, an era where many firms are vying for gamers’ time. Apple and Google want to get in the living room and are waging war against Nintendo and Sony. Microsoft already has an edge in living room entertainment with its Xbox Live service, but it wants a piece of mobile as well. It’s a confusing time for gamemakers. Where should they take their titles? Which platforms will provide the best experiences? Who will make them the most money?
Register here.
We’ll have a steady drumbeat of speakers as we get closer to GamesBeat 2013′s October date. We expect to have more than 80 of the gaming industry’s best lined up for our fifth annual event.
Each year, GamesBeat follows a big trend. In 2009, we focused on how “All The World’s a Game,” with the explosion of games on the global stage. In 2010, GamesBeat@GDC focused on “Disruption 2.0.” In 2011, our theme was “Mobile Games Level Up,” investigating the busy intersection of games and mobile technology. In 2012, we  explored “The Crossover Era ,” the time when so many big game companies and startups were transforming themselves by expanding from one market to the next. Our judges, meanwhile, are already busy picking the finalists in the Who’s Got Game Innovation Showdown for the best game startup.
As companies adapt to change, we’re witnessing disruption, adaptation, consolidation, innovation, and the arrival of big money. We’re talking billions of dollars that are at stake. We’re expecting 400 notables from throughout the game industry — social, mobile, online, and console. Please join us.
