The Zackees turn-signal gloves  might be the greatest gift to cyclists since the helmet.
A unique fusion of fashion and tech, the gloves have their own arrow-shaped strings of LEDs, which cyclists can use to signal that they’re turning. They’re the sort of thing that screams “geek,” but if they keep the wearer safe, geekiness might not matter so much.
Zackees pitches the gloves slightly differently: You’ll need them for safety but wear them because they’re fashionable. That “utility + tech + fashion” combination is core to the Zackees, which were developed by a former Google engineer, a fashion designer, and a robotics specialist.
Expect these things to be everywhere before long.
While I’m not sure how fashionable the gloves are, it’s hard to argue that they won’t significantly improve the wearer’s safety on the road. Increasing visibility is huge deal for cyclists, who are often invisible to the very people who pose them the most harm. (The gloves should also work well for runners, skateboarders, and rollerbladers.)
The Zackees team plans to launch a Kickstarter campaign for the gloves on Dec. 9, with an estimated delivery date of next April. We’ve still waiting to hear how much they will cost.
