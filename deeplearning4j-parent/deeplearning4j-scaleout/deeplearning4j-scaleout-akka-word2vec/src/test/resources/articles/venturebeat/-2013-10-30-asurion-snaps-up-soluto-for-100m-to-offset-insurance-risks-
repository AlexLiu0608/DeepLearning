It’s been a good year for the Israeli tech industry.
Nashville, Tenn.-based device insurer Asurion has acquired Tel Aviv-based  Soluto , a cloud-based service that lets you manage other devices remotely, for somewhere between $100 to $130 million, according to multiple reports . An Asurion representative declined to comment on the financial details of the deal.
This is the third major acquisition of an Israeli high-tech firm this year. In June, Google bought crowdsourced navigation company Waze for $1.3 billion. Two weeks ago, Facebook snapped up mobile-analytics startup Onavo for an estimated $150 to $200 million.
The acquisition is a logical one for Asurion, which makes most of its money providing technical support and insurance for mobile devices. The more devices it fixes, the fewer it has to replace. AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, and others resell Asurion’s protection policies to their customers.
“Our research shows that consumers are not equipped to manage a growing number of complex and interconnected devices,” said Tony Detter, the senior vice president of global product management at Asurion, in a statement.
Soluto entered the mobile market four months ago with the introduction of its remote-support system for iOS devices. It also lets you manage PCs and servers over the web. But the company is not yet profitable: Soluto just began recording revenue earlier this year after offering its services for free since its 2008 launch.
Soluto co-founders Tomer Dvir and Ishay Green, who each own 10 percent of the company, are the biggest earners from the exit. (Dvir is the chief executive officer; Green is no longer with the company.) Soluto has raised about $18 million from outside investors including Index Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Proxima Ventures.
Soluto and its 40 employees will remain in Tel Aviv, according to Israeli business publication Globes . The company has registered more than 3 million downloads and 15 million “user actions” over the past five years, according to Asurion.
