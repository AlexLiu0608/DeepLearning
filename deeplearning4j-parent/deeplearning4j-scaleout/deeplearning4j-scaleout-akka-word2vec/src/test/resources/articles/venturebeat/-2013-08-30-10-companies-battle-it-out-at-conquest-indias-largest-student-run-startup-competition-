Conquest isn’t your typical startup competition.
It’s based in India, not Silicon Valley. It’s run by students, not a large corporation or VC fund. And it’s been around for almost 10 years now.
After starting out as a business plan competition in 2004 by the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) in Pilani, India, Conquest refined itself over time to find the best and brightest of local startups. In 2007 it opened up to international companies. In 2010 it dumped the focus on business plans altogether so that it can focus on startups with the most innovative ideas (even if they don’t have a clue how to make money yet).
“We’re the first in India to have shifted from a plain business plan model to a startup challenge, so it’s similar to a Y Combinator demo day,” said Suvonil Chatterjee, Conquest’s coordinator and a fourth-year student at BITS Pilani who has been involved with the competition for the past four years.
For this year’s competition, which will be held on September 15 in New Delhi, Conquest dug through thousands of applications to find 50 promising companies. All of those companies received extensive mentoring over the past four months, and the 10 strongest were chosen to compete at next month’s finale, which is expected to have an audience of more than 600 people. The finalists will be competing for the Hottest Startup of India Award, sponsored by Groupon India, and the India Rising Star Award, sponsored by Gandhi Capital.
As part of this year’s competition, Conquest offered around $4,500 (300,000 rupees) of equity-free seed money to all of the finalists, and more than $151,000 (10 million rupees) in incubation opportunities. The finalists will also receive sponsored services, including cloud computing, CRM, and customer support worth around $300,000. Most of the finalists have already received seed funding and are currently seeking their Series A rounds, Chatterjee tells me.
Conquest will host two grand panel discussions with some top Indian entrepreneurs and investors, including Amit Ranjan, cofounder of Slideshare; Ankur Warikoo, CEO of Groupon India; Alok Kejriwal, founder and CEO of Games2Win; Dev Khare of Lightspeed Ventures; and Rajesh Sawhney, founder of the GSF Accelerator and GSF Superangels. Google’s India business development team will also sponsor the best social startup at the competition.
