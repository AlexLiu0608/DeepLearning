The conference—which is an exploration of the future of modern software—is inviting 800-plus disruptive developers, technologists, and creatives together to help imagine, build, and craft the future of software innovation. According to New Relic, the conference offers 40-plus sessions dedicated to data, hardware, and creative-engineering cultures.

New Relic users will also have a dedicated user track with the company’s own engineers hosting sessions on how to use the New Relic Platform to better monitor and optimize their web and mobile applications.
