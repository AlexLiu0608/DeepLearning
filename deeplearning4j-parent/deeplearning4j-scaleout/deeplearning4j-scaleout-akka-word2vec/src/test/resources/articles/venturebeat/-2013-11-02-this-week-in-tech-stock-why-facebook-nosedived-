Facebook was on fire this week — not in the Sherman-does-Atlanta sense, but in the Katniss-from-Hunger-Games sense. So why did its stock tank?

And its stock price is down around 8 percent for the week. Say what?
As our own John Koetsier explains, twelve little words from the investors’ call were enough to seal the deal: “We did see a decrease in daily users specifically among younger teens.”

Comcast highlighted the success of its video-on-demand offerings and saw a nice 3 percent lift. Also on the media side, Netflix reported 40 million subscribers, proving its focus on original content focus is paying off, but investors were squeamish, leading to a 7 percent tumble.
The real stars for the earnings season were Brightcove, which experienced a 6 percent incline post-earnings, and Amazon was up 10 percent, thanks to steady growth and in spite of a few important but unanswered questions.
Here’s a look at the stock price movement in percentages:
