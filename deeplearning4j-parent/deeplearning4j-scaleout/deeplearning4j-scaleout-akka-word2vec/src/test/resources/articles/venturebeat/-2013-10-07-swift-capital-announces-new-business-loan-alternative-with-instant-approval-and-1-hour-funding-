WILMINGTON, Del.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 7, 2013–
Swift       Capital , a small business working capital provider, announced a       first-of-its-kind working capital solution that eliminates all       paperwork, including monthly bank account and/or credit card processing       statements. A breakthrough in small business financing, funding is       approved online with decisions granted in less than one minute. Funds       are then transferred to a business account at applicant’s current bank       in under an hour.
“This new product will revolutionize the small business loan and       business cash advance market,” said Ed Harycki, founder and CEO of Swift       Capital. “With instant online approval and zero paperwork, small       business owners will find an elegantly simple and fast solution to their       cash flow needs.”

Currently ‘by invitation-only’, Swift Capital       began offering the product last month. Swift Capital expects to open the       product to the general public later this year. “Now business owners can       get access to funding at some of the best rates in the market, through a       revolutionary paperwork-free process that delivers funding in less than       one hour,” said Ed Harycki.
