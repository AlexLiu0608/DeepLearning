Web-based Firefox OS is adding a new phone to its device lineup today: LG’s Fireweb. The phone is coming first to Brazil via Telefonica Vivo and will then roll out to other parts of Latin America, and it’ll run Firefox OS in all its pared-down glory.
The phone has a 4-inch screen and a 5-inch camera and enough apps and features to meet the needs of an average smartphone user — and to exceed the expectations of a first-time smartphone user.
The Fireweb will come with the latest version of Firefox OS , which includes speed and performance enhancements as well as expanded language support.
Here’s a detailed hands-on with the Fireweb:
A Telefonica rep said they will be “affordable” for the consumers and geographies for which they are intended. On the Vivo site, prices range from $60 to $206.
“We built Firefox OS as part of [Firefox maker] Mozilla’s mission to put the power of the Web in people’s hands and offer the best Web experience possible,” said Mozilla COO Jay Sullivan in a statement on the news.
“We’re happy to see Firefox OS gain momentum with partners launching new devices in new markets and developers around the world being inspired to innovate. Our partnership with Telefónica Vivo demonstrates the rich, new experiences offered on Firefox OS by combining the best global and local content with LG’s elegant new device experience.”
