Forget Photoshop and 99designs — DesignMantic could be the next big thing in graphic design for the common man. Or woman. Or grandma.
DesignMantic offers a do-it-yourself design studio built with HTML5, so you can create a graphic for your organization or event right in your web browser. It’s ludicrously easy to make a logo: plug in a name, filter by industry, choose from a ton of preset options, and start tweaking with the simple editing tools. If you like the end result, it costs $29 to download a high-resolution version of your customized design.
Founded earlier this year, the bootstrapped startup aims to offer the simplest suite of design tools anywhere on the web. It competes with companies like LogoMaker and LogoYes , but their tools start you off with a blank slate. DesignMantic is about editing preexisting designs — and because it’s built with HTML5, it works on both desktop and mobile devices.
“What we’ve done is make the whole process as simple, intuitive, and affordable as possible, without sacrificing quality,” said DesignMantic founder Zaheer Dodhia. “If you give people the right options and make everything easy to use, they can figure out for themselves how they want their designs to look.”
DesignMantic suggests some new logos for VentureBeat
DesignMantic has racked up over 150,000 downloads in just six months — although the startup gave most of those away for free, so it remains to be seen if the service can maintain its rapid growth as it begins to monetize.
The DesignMantic team is currently developing a mobile app, which it expects to release early next year. It’s also working on new language options (German is next) and on expanding its feature set beyond logos.
“DesignMantic wants to offer complete design solutions, so customers can get their logos, stationery designs, brochures, websites, signage, and any other designs all in one place,” marketing coordinator Danielle Pacelli told VentureBeat. “It’s going to take us time, but we’ll get there.”
DesignMantic founder Zaheer Dodhia is also CEO of crowdsourced design marketplace MycroBurst, but thinks that service appeals to “a completely different type of customer” than DesignMantic.
DesignMantic currently has ten employees between its two offices in Langhorne, Pennsylvania and Karachi, Pakistan.
