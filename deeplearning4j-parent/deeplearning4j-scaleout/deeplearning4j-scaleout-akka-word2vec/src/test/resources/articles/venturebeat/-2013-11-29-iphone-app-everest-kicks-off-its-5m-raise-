Everest , an iPhone app for goal achievement, has filed a Form D for a $5 million fundraise*.
So far, the startup has collected around $200,000 of that amount. Previously, the company raised $1.7 million in April  and a $300,000 seed round in 2012.
Previous investors include Peter Thiel, Behance founder Scott Belsky, Streamlined Ventures, and others. Two unnamed investors have so far committed to the current round.
What the app actually does strikes us cynical souls as a bit hippie-dippy:
Everest is a place to capture all your dreams and goals while focusing on one: your Everest. Build your Dream Team to stay motivated, easily track your progress, get suggestions when you’re stuck, and be a part of a community that helps you be your best self.
The company states that popular goals named in the app include losing weight, paying off debts, learning languages and instruments, and writing a book.*
*As an author of multiple books, I can attest that an app will probably not help you with that. Yes, I’m a jerk.
Here’s what she looks like:
