If you’re feeling inspired by something you saw on Facebook, you’ll soon be able to donate to its cause straight through your Facebook feed.
The social network announced today that it has created a donate button that will sit alongside any post made by a partner-charitable-organization. It is just starting to roll out the feature after being inspired by the response to its November Red Cross campaign to send relief to the Philippines.
A Facebook spokesperson told VentureBeat that, “100 percent of the payment goes to the non-profit.”
Facebook does not take a fee or a percentage of each donation.
When you click on donate, a small dialogue box pops up and lets you enter the amount you’d like to give and your payment information without ever leaving the news feed page. Facebook says it also hopes people take advantage of the “share” button to help make charitable posts viral.
Though charities aren’t known to have a lot of disposable money lying around, it could be a sign that non-profits should step up their content game. If financially feasible, putting together videos like the ones you see on Upworthy, or coming up with cool campaign and contests could attract givers on social media.
Facebook has initially partnered with 18 programs:
