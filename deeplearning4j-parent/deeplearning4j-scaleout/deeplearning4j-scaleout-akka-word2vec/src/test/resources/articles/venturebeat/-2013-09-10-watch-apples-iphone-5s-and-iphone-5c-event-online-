Apple disappointed many fans today when it didn’t make a livestream available for its new iPhone media event , but now you can at least watch the entire event on the company’s site .
Marvel at Apple design head Jony Ive describing the iPhone 5C as “beautifully, unapologetically plastic.” (Since when was that a good thing?) Watch Phil Schiller, Apple’s head of marketing, get all hot and bothered over the iPhone 5S’s  “stunning” design and fingerprint scanner. And rock out to Elvis Costello’s surprise appearance.
Or if you’re like me, you’ll just yearn for the days when Steve Jobs was onstage weaving his spell.
