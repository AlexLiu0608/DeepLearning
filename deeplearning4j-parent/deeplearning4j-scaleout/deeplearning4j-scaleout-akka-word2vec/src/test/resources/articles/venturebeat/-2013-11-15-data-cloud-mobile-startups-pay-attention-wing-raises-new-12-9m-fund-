Good news for mobile, cloud, and big data startups: A newly established venture-capital group focused on those sectors just got some more money to invest.
Wing Venture Partners has brought in $12.9 million, according to a fresh filing submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission. That’s on top of the $111 million fund Wing announced in July.
The filing, under the name Wing Strategic Partners, L.P., refers to a “side-by-side fund that was formed to go along with our fund that was formed earlier this year,” Hilary Strain, Wing’s chief financial officer, told VentureBeat during a brief phone call.

The news could mean Wing, based in Menlo Park, Calif., has the capacity to invest in at least one additional startup. A press release announcing Wing’s launch stated that the firm will typically pump $8 million to $10 million into each portfolio company.
Gaurav Garg, a former partner at Sequoia Capital, and Peter Wagner, a former managing partner at Accel Partners, founded Wing.
They want to back companies focused on cloud computing, mobile, or data. They’ve already funded data-center networking startup Cumulus Networks , big-data analytics player Platfora , security vendor FireEye  (which recently went public  with a stunning successful IPO), and hybrid-storage provider Nimble Storage , among others.
Wagner and Garg declined to comment on the new fund.
