While Twitter won’t reveal it’s numbers in today’s secret IPO filing, PrivCo has an idea of where Twitter stands financially .
PrivCo does market research on privately held companies using its “proprietary technology” to make predictions and guesses on often unreleased financial data. Twitter, which is a notoriously secret private company, filed to go public today, but it did so in secrecy. It filed a confidential S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission — something companies that make less than $1 billion in revenue can do under the new JOBS Act.
Twitter will make “over $500 million” in revenue this year, according to PrivCo, doubled from the $245 million PrivCo says Twitter made in 2012. It also predicts that Twitter will go public on the New York Stock Exchange as opposed to the NASDAQ, which caused Facebook quite a bit of trouble in its May 2012 IPO. PrivCo believes Twitter will be paying a lot of attention to how Facebook executed its roadshow and IPO and that it will try to time its IPO for right after its “seasonally strongest fourth quarter.”
It also believes Twitter will price the IPO at $15 billion.
We’ve reached out to PrivCo for more information on its methodology. Of course, this is only speculation and until Twitter makes its filing public, it will continue to be speculation.
PrivCo’s numbers, however, are in keeping with competitor eMarketer ‘s findings. eMarketer gets a little more specific, predicting that Twitter will make $582.8 million in revenue this year, jumping up to $1 billion in 2014. The company further speculates that Twitter made $288 million in revenue last year.
