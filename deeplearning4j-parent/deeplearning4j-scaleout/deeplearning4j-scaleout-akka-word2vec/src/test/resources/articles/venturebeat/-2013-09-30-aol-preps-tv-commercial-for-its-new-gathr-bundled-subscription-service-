The last time I remember seeing an AOL television commercial was probably when their dialup business was still marketing itself by sending out CDs through snail mail. Soon, however, the company is planning to return to the small screen with a multiplaform advertising campaign for its new service, Gathr, according to AllThingsD .
Gathr , which launched in beta testing earlier this year, is attempting to bundle lots of different premium services into a single subscription that you can customize and add on to. For example, a bundle might consist of deals from LivingSocial, the ad-free music offering from Pandora (Pandora One), five RedBox one-night DVD rentals, and more. Initially, it offers six prepackaged bundles that range in price from $15 to $30.
It’s an interesting move for AOL to push this service, because it does have a rather successful history in the subscription service business. It’s dialup subscriptions — while nearly useless at this point (when considering the amount of free options available, anyways) — still generates a good chunk of revenue for the company. If AOL can manage to jumpstart a subscription bundle service it can continue making this a viable part of the business.
As for the TV commercials, AOL plans to advertise Gathr in only three major markets (Seattle, Philadelphia, and Atlanta), for now. The commercials are tentatively schedule to start airing later this fall.
