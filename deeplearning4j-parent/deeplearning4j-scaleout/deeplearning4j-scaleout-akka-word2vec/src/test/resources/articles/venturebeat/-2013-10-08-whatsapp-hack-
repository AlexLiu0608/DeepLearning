WhatsApp, the popular free messaging app, was hacked and defaced yesterday — but don’t worry, it was only the website.
A group, which calls itself the KDMS Team of Plaestinian [sic] Hackers” took over the company’s domain whatsapp.com posting pro-Palestine messages and threats toward anonymity. One message said, “There is no full security, we can catch you!” with an image of one of the hacktivist group Anonymous’ insignia — the headless, suited man — with the words “Anonymous Palestine” written around it. It seems a little contradictory, but we get the point for the most part.
It seems KDMS was able to take over the site by changing the IP address associated with the domain, according to CNET . The hackers reportedly changed the IP address on record for the domain today, redirecting any visitors to their new page. This likely means the WhatsApp website itself wasn’t harmed.
“Our website was hijacked for a small period of time, during which attackers redirected our website to another IP address. We can confirm that no user data was lost or compromised. We are committed to user security and are working with our domain hosting vendor Network Solutions on further investigation of this incident,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said in a statement.
But it doesn’t seem like we’ll be hearing from the KDMS Team again in the near future. The very last message left on WhatsApp’s website reads:
“Hacked by KDMS Team. Now we will quit hacking.”
