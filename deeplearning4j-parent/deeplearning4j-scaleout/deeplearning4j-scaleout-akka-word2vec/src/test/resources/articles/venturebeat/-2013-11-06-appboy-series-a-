46 percent of people who download an app stop using it after one month, according to Appboy ‘s website.
To encourage them to stick around, Appboy helps app publishers profile each user, segment them into groups based on how profitable they are likely to be, and hit them with in-app messages, emails, and “news” to encourage them to keep using your app.
The tools must be working, because the company now has more than 1,000 clients, a number that’s increased more than fourfold in the last nine months. Clients include Text+, Urban Outfitters, GSN, SnipSnap, Bloomberg, Shape, and PopSci, according to the company’s press release today.
On the back of that momentum, the company has raised a $7.6 million series A round to support its ”mobile relationship management” system and expand it into new industries, including gaming and social networking. (It already appears to have focused on retail and publishers.) The company has also launched a new visual identity and a redesigned website.
The biggest competitor in the “MRM” space is probably Urban Airship , which helps developers embed marketing and customer relationship management tools into their apps.
Funding was led by Icon Venture Partners, with additional investment from IDG Ventures and Buddy Media CEO Mike Lazerow. Appboy previously raised $2.5 million in two rounds of seed funding from Blumberg Capital, Metamorphic Ventures, and others.
