A day after Google teased a Glass hardware upgrade, the company is showing it off.
The updated Glass, which you can see in the photo above, looks just like its predecessor — with one main exception. As the photo shows, the Glass refresh comes with the addition of a mono ear piece, which joins the bone conduction tech found in the first generation Glass.
What Google didn’t show, however, was how the new Glass hardware will work with prescription frames though the company did link to an image of an early Glass prototype to show what it should look like.
Generally, there doesn’t seem to be too many cosmetic changes with the Glass hardware refresh though we’ll have to wait until Google is done teasing it before we can say for sure.
