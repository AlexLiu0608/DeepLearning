From the ridiculous to the intriguing, today is all about trademarks, it seems.
Tesla Motors has applied for a new trademark with the name ‘Model E’, specifically referring to “automobiles and structural parts therefore.”
The company filed for registration of the trademark on August 5, serial number 86029275 . This has since been updated to “new application–record initialized not assigned to examiner” status, meaning the trademark is still pending.
Assuming the trademark is granted, it has us wondering which model in Tesla’s future could be granted the Model E title.
We already know Tesla’s crossover model — the next to arrive — will be called the Model X . The name of the company’s BMW 3-Series and Mercedes C-Class rival sedan has not yet been announced though, nor has the name of a smaller crossover model expected to be based on that platform.
At the moment, the new smaller sedan is referred to internally as ‘Blue Star’ , after ‘White Star’ became the Model S.
Tesla is expected to sell as many as five different models by 2016 : the two sedans and crossovers mentioned above, plus a sports car to replace the much-loved Roadster. Could the Model E be the firm’s next two-seater?
It’s all too early to tell for sure. Let the rumor mill start here…
