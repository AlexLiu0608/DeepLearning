Local Motors Debuts Crowdfunding Capability to Bring Vehicular       Innovations to Market
PHOENIX–(BUSINESS WIRE)–December 3, 2013–
Local       Motors, Inc. announces the launch of its first crowdfunding campaign       for the Cruiser electric and gas-powered bicycles, designed by Local Motors community       member Ianis Vasilatos. In partnership with San Francisco,       California-based Crowdtilt ,       the Local Motors Cruiser crowdfunding campaign is the first step in       integrating a fully customizable crowdfunding capability into the       CoCreate vehicle innovation platform.

“The addition of crowdfunding to our existing co-creation,       micro-manufacturing, and retail capabilities completes the tool set used       by our global community to bring the most innovative vehicular products       to market,” said Local Motors Chief Strategy Officer, Justin Fishkin.
The Cruiser Crowdfunding Campaign has a target raise of $50,000 and is       the first Local Motors-sponsored crowdfunding effort dedicated to       bringing the designs of CoCreate community members to market.
“We are thrilled to partner with Local Motors to power the pre-sale of       Local Motors’ new Cruiser motorized bicycles,” said James Beshara, CEO       of Crowdtilt. “This is a perfect example of how existing brands and companies can engage with their community to not only design and develop       innovative new products, but also to help bring these new products to       market and into production through crowdfunding. We’re very excited to       see this technology applied to the auto industry.”
About The Local Motors Cruisers
The Cruiser was designed in response to a challenge posted to the Local       Motors CoCreate community to design a motorized bicycle reminiscent of       the early 1900s board track racers. The winning concept, called the       Ariel Cruiser by Ianis Vasilatos of Romania, was selected from a field       of more than 100 submissions, and development began in July 2013. Six       prototypes – three electric and three gas-powered – debuted at the 2013       SEMA show in Las Vegas, Nevada in November. This crowdfunding campaign       will allow Local Motors to complete the development and put into       production both versions of this iconic new design.
Electric Cruiser
The current electric version has a rear hub motor with regenerative       brakes, and can travel 20+ miles on one battery set, and up to 40 miles       with a secondary battery.
Gas Cruiser
The gas-powered Cruiser is projected to run for up to 70 miles on a       single tank of gas and, on average, will get up to 150 mpg.
About the Designer
Ianis Vasilatos, a production manager at the Queen Marry Theatre in       Oradea, Romania by day and a talented and passionate vehicle designer by       night, has been a member of the Local Motors CoCreate community since       April 2011. Ianis received a $2,000 cash prize for his winning design,       celebrated the debut of both the electric and gas-powered prototypes of       his design with the Local Motors team at the 2013 SEMA show in Las       Vegas, Nevada, and will receive the first gas-powered production version       of his design.
“To design a motorized bicycle reminiscent of the early 1900s was a       dream of mine that began a long time ago. And my passion for this era       will never stop,” said Ianis Vasilatos. “All parts of my Cruiser design       were intended to give a nod back to the history of board track racing       and early motorbicycles: the motor and engine covering, the fuel tank       and straps that hold the tank, the other elements of leather and the       seat are all very respectful to this history.”
About the Campaign
The Cruiser Crowdfunding campaign initially seeks to raise $50,000 from       the campaign’s supporters. If that goal is reached, the Cruiser will       immediately launch into full production at Local Motors Microfactory       locations in Phoenix, Arizona and Las Vegas, Nevada.
Featuring several reward tiers, ranging from $1 to $5,000, the campaign       offers Cruiser fans and supporters a variety of participation options       and incentive levels. Offerings range from inclusion on the Cruiser       Supporters list, to limited edition Cruiser T-shirts and signed prints,       to the opportunity to own one of the first 30 production units. Four of       the first prototypes ever built will also be available as rewards,       giving supporters the opportunity to own a piece of vehicle history.
Upon completion of the Cruiser Crowdfunding Campaign, Local Motors will       look to embed crowdfunding capabilities, supported by Crowdtilt, into       its CoCreate platform. This expanded capability is a natural evolution       for Local Motors as it will empower independent vehicle innovators       around the world to access the funding required to bring their       individual vehicle innovations to market.
“As a crowd-powered vehicle innovation marketplace, there are thousands       of designs within the Local Motors community that deserve to see the       light of day and alone, we at Local Motors can only help to bring a       fraction of them to market,” said Local Motors CEO Jay Rogers.
“By integrating crowdfunding capabilities into our platform we will       empower our community to deliver a world of vehicle innovations – from       full vehicles and portable electric chargers to specialty automotive       components – an accelerated pace not possible through traditional       vehicle design, development and funding methods.”
