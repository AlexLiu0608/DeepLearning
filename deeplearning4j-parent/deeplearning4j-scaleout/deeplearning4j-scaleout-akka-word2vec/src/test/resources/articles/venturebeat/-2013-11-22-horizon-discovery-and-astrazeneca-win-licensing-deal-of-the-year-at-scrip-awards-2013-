CAMBRIDGE–(BUSINESS WIRE)–November 22, 2013–
Horizon Discovery (Horizon) has won “Licensing Deal of the Year” at the       Scrip Awards 2013, for their agreement with AstraZeneca to explore       Horizon’s first-in-class kinase target program HD-001 as a means of       developing novel therapies for multiple cancer types. The Scrip Awards       are highly prestigious, recognizing excellence in both pharma and       biotech companies and those firms that support them.
The HD-001 program has the potential to be developed into a treatment       based on modulation of a novel kinase. This target has been shown to be       mutated in a range of cancer types including colon and lung.       Importantly, the target has also been shown to play a key role in K-Ras       mutant tumours. K-Ras is mutated in up to 40% of all cancer types       causing resistance to many of the available targeted therapeutics and as       a result is associated with poor patient outcomes, which makes the       development of molecular targeted therapies against the gene a       significant unmet need. A case study on the development of the HD-001       program can be found here: www.horizondiscovery.com/media/item/67
Dr Chris Torrance, CSO and leader of the HD-001 program at Horizon,       commented: “We were excited to partner this program with AstraZeneca,       and we have made good progress since the start of the collaboration. We       are delighted that the quality of the program has now also been       recognised by Scrip, and are honored to accept the award.”

About Horizon Discovery www.horizondiscovery.com/
Horizon Discovery Limited (Horizon) is a leading provider of research       tools to support translational genomics research and the development of       personalized medicines. Using GENESISTM, Horizon is able to       alter any endogenous gene sequence of a human or mammalian cell-line       quickly, reliably and without introducing unwanted and confounding       genotypes and/or phenotypes.
Horizon has applied GENESIS to create over 500 X-MAN™ cell lines, the       world’s first source of genetically-defined and patient-relevant human       cell lines, accurately modeling the disease-causing mutations found in       cancer patients. These ‘patients-in-a-test-tube’ are being used by       academic and industry leaders to identify the effect of individual or       compound genetic mutations on drug activity, patient responsiveness, and       resistance, leading to the successful prediction of which patient       sub-groups will respond to currently-available and future drug       treatments. This enables the design of shorter, more focused, and less       expensive clinical trials, ultimately providing the tools to identify       the ‘right drugs’ for the ‘right patients’ based upon the unique genetic       mutations that define their disease.
In addition to X-MAN cell lines, Horizon provides GENESIS and X-MAN™       derived products and services, with industrial application in:       bio-pharmaceutical process optimization; clinical diagnostic       development; drug discovery & development; and the provision of       reference standards for genomic-based clinical research platforms.
