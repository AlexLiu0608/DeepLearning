Smartphones did a number on us. They changed the way we communicate, the way we interact with the Web, heck, even our posture.
But more world-changing technology is headed our way, and much of it is already in production.
Today we have products like SmartThings, which lets you control both non- and Internet-connected devices with your smartphone. We’ve also got the Leap Motion, 3D printing, and, of course Google Glass.
The digital eye wear could have a much bigger ripple effect in the optometry world. Google is working with vision benefits and lens-designing company VSP Global . The company will help Google get Glass into optometrist offices and figure out a way to get prescription lenses into the device. From there it may also look at new frames for Google Glass that might make it more accessible to people who want a more fashionable choice.
So, what about those huge products of tomorrow? Well, let’s riff off of Google Glass for a second. The Center of Microsystems Technology is already working on a digital contact lens that will include a curved LCD display within the lens. It will also come in prescription form. Maybe one day we’ll even have a digital prescription lens that can change prescription based on user need.
We’ve also got technology like hand-controlled holograms from Elon Musk; “smart glass” that helps with energy efficiency; and eye-tracking technology for hands-free video game playing and more.

And let us know if we’ve missed anything. What are some of the most amazing technologies you’ve seen out there that simply made you stop and go, “That’s going to be huge.”
