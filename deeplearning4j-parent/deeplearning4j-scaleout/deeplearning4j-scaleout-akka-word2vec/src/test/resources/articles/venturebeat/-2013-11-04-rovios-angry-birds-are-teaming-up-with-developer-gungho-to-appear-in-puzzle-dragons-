The Angry Birds are coming in for a crash-landing in Puzzle & Dragons.
Developers Rovio and GungHo Online Entertainment announced a cross-over event today that will have the fowls from physics puzzler Angry Birds making an appearance in GungHo’s popular Puzzle & Dragons role-playing game.
Starting on Nov. 18 and continuing through Dec. 1, Puzzle & Dragons players can challenge an Angry Birds-themed dungeon. This level will feature the familiar avian characters from the Angry Birds series as the enemies.
“We are excited to announce the collaboration of Puzzle & Dragons and the Angry Birds games from Rovio Entertainment,” Puzzle & Dragons creator Daisuke Yamamoto said in a statement. “Angry Birds is one of the most recognizable entertainment franchises in the world, and we are thrilled to be working alongside Rovio to give our fans a look at what it would be like if Angry Birds characters invaded the world of Puzzle & Dragons.”
In addition to the cross-over event, Rovio is holding an illustration contest starting today. The developer is inviting fans to submit drawings based on the theme of the Angry Birds showing up in Puzzle & Dragons. The contest will continue until Nov. 20, and fans can enter their work on the Angry Birds’ Facebook page .
“At Rovio we are very happy to bring Angry Birds together with Puzzle & Dragons, and to introduce the fun contest to both games’ fans all over the world,” Rovio vice president of games Jami Laes said in a statement. “It will be exciting to see what our creative fans will come up with.”
Rovio and GungHo Online are two of mobile gaming’s biggest studios. Rovio had early success with its Angry Birds titles, while GungHo is on the upswing with Puzzle & Dragons, which is on pace to make $1 billion per year .
Japanese gamers have downloaded Puzzle & Dragons more than 20 million times. That’s a huge portion of the population, but the title isn’t performing as well in the U.S. Picking up American gamers is likely the motivation behind this event. We’ve reached out to GungHo to ask if this is the case, and we’ll update this post with any new information.
This isn’t the first cross-over promotion GungHo has held with its RPG puzzler. The developer teamed up with Finnish studio SuperCell twice before to cross-promote Puzzle & Dragons with mobile strategy title Clash of Clans. Prior to the second event, GungHo partnered up with Japanese investor SoftBank to make a $1.5 billion investment in 51 percent of SuperCell.
