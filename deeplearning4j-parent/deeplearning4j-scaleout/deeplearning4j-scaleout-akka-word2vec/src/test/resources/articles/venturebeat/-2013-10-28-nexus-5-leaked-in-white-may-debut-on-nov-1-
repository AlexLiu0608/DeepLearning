Sit tight Android fans, the Nexus 5 is nigh — and in white.
The ever-cunning gadget leaker Evleaks yesterday posted the above shot of the Nexus 5, showing off a white case that we haven’t seen before. Evleaks also hinted that the phone will officially make its debut on November 1.
That timing makes sense, considering Google “mistakenly” revealed the Nexus 5 on the Play store a few weeks ago. Even though it was taken down quickly, the listing was fairly complete, listing the LG-built Nexus 5′s specs (5-inch screen, quad-core CPU, and improved camera) and affordable $349 unlocked price. It also made it pretty clear that the phone would be coming soon.
Just like last year’s Nexus 4, the most intriguing aspect of this new Nexus appears to be its price. There are plenty of other 5-inch phones on the market (including some that run stock Android, like the Google Play variants of the Galaxy S4 and HTC One). But at $349 unlocked, the Nexus 5 will be the most affordable way to snag a modern and unlocked smartphone.
Let’s just hope it’s not missing any new features to get to that price, like the Nexus 4′s sad lack of LTE.
