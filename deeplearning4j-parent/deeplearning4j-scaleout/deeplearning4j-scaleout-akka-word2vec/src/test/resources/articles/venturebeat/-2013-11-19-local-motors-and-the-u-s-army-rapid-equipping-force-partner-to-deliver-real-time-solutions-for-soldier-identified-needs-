Innovative Army CoCreate Portal, Developed by Local Motors, Will       Empower Soldiers to Refine Operational Challenges, and to Design and       Prototype Solutions
PHOENIX–(BUSINESS WIRE)–November 19, 2013–
Local       Motors and the U.S.       Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) announce the development of an       online platform that will connect soldiers, civilians, makers and       scientists in the real-time development of solutions to enhance       warfighter performance and safety. This new platform, called Army       CoCreate and powered by Local Motors, will engage a broad audience to       tackle military challenges.
The Army CoCreate platform and its community will provide the       inspiration for at least two live prototyping workshops called       Make-a-Thons. Ideas submitted to Army CoCreate that receive the most       support will provide the subject matter for these events.
Partnership
“We are excited and honored to be providing a platform that will give a       voice to the Army’s dedicated soldiers,” said Local Motors CEO Jay       Rogers. “The ability to drive real-time design and the development of       solutions like the ones I needed when I deployed to Iraq as a United       States Marine is extremely rewarding. Knowing that what we are       developing here will provide dominant speed-to-battlefield capabilities       that improve Soldier performance and increase safety in active theaters       around the globe is extremely rewarding.”
The REF officially partnered with Local Motors in August 2013 to develop       Army CoCreate. This proof-of-concept effort is a logical expansion of       the work REF has been doing since 2002 to develop solutions and quickly       get them to Soldiers in the battlefield.
“When you have a situation where you need good solutions in a       time-critical manner, it is important to tap into the expertise of those       closest to the problem,” said Colonel Steven Sliwa, Director of the U.S.       Army’s Rapid Equipping Force. “As the rapid response capability for the       U.S. Army, REF must work closely with Soldiers to understand urgent       requirements and to get the right solution into the hands of the       warfighter as quickly as possible.”
“Soldiers are living and breathing the fight, day-in and day-out, so       they have the best ideas for new capabilities to solve their most urgent       challenges,” said Sergeant First Class Adam Asclipiadis. “We need to       connect those ideas to the people who can make innovations a reality.”
How Army CoCreate Works:
Army CoCreate, an online collaboration platform led by Local       Motors-trained moderators, will address military challenges in a phased       approach. The Army CoCreate process will have four distinct lines of       effort:
1. Identify Problems. (Ideas)
Big or small, ideas are the foundation for innovative projects. Army       CoCreate participants will identify specific Soldier challenges for the       community to address. Community members can then vote or comment on       their favorite Soldier challenge idea. The more votes an idea receives,       the more likely it is to be selected as the main Army CoCreate project.
2. Suggest Solutions. (Designs)
Participants can also upload their own sketches, graphics and renderings       for a specific Soldier solution. These designs can help inform the main       Army CoCreate project, or inspire people who can help make the design a       reality. Users can like, comment on or follow their favorite designs       that may or may not be directly related to a problem identified on the       ideas page.
3. Tackle a Project. (Projects)
Based on the community’s ideas, designs and feedback from the global       Army CoCreate community, REF will select the main Army CoCreate project       for in-depth collaboration. Site moderators will post detailed Soldier       challenge information such as size, weight, power, operation and       endurance guidelines; and community members will select and contribute       to the part of the project that interests them most.
4. Build Prototypes. (Make-a-Thons)
In the final phase of Army CoCreate REF will demonstrate the ability to       receive electronic blueprints and rapidly prototype from a forward       location. The Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE) Fort Benning will       host two week-long innovation workshops called Make-a-Thons where the       resulting virtual designs from the online community will be prototyped       using 3D printing capabilities and the REF expeditionary lab.       Make-a-Thons will take place December 9-13, 2013, and January 13-16,       2014.
This partnership, and the Army CoCreate proof-of-concept effort,       demonstrates REF’s commitment to include the Soldier in the solution       development process. The emphasis for this effort is to capture the       ideas of Soldiers returning from Afghanistan.
“Right now, the Army is filled with resources, Soldiers returning home       from Afghanistan rich with operational experience from that conflict. It       is important to maintain institutional knowledge of what we have       learned,” said Sliwa. “Though the problems addressed by the CoCreate       community may not be theater-specific, we want to determine if this       technique can capture lessons learned, as well as assist the Soldier in       refining requirements and developing solutions.”
Membership in the Army CoCreate online community is free and open to the       public. Visit ArmyCoCreate.com to join the community and help drive the next generation of       soldier-focused innovations.
