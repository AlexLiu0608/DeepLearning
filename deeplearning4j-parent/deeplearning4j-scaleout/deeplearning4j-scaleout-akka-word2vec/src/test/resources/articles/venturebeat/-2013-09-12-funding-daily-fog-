Slammed by product demand, Jawbone gets another $100M
Jawbone , it seems, is a victim of its own success. The hardware maker, which recently upgraded its Jambox wireless speaker, has seen considerable demand for its devices — so much that it hasn’t been able to scale its operations fast enough to meet that demand.

Because it’s a lot quicker to borrow money than raise it through equity financing, the bulk — $93 million — comes via debt funding. The rest of the new money comes via a smaller $20 million equity round led by existing Jawbone investors like Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Khosla Ventures, and Sequoia Capita.
