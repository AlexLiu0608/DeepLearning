FreeMyApps is one of those apps that rewards a mobile user for downloading an app. Now maker Fiksu is upgrading it so that it rewards users for taking actions that are more compelling for mobile-app advertisers.
Boston-based Fiksu is announcing today that the enhancements will help app publishers achieve deeper levels of engagement from users, who are most often gamers trying to get free stuff in their favorite games.
I was introduced to FreeMyApps by my nephew, who was trying out all sorts of apps a couple of times each so that he could quickly get free stuff. He never really reengaged with the apps he was forced to download, but he enjoyed getting gift cards that he could use to buy more games.
With the upgrades, FreeMyApps can now get app users to do more things, such as completing a tutorial, reaching a certain game level, or registering. If users do so, they get their rewards. FreeMyApps already has 1.6 million monthly active users who discover and engage with apps in the Apple iTunes App Store and the Google Play store.
Indies can create their own promotions in a self-serve way to get the FreeMyApps community motivated to take actions in their apps. Campaigns for such advertisements cost as little as $1,000. Users can earn credits that can be redeemed for rewards, such as gift cards for iTunes, Google Play, Amazon.com, and more. They also earn credits for referring others to the service.
“Enthusiastic iOS and Android users around the globe have turned to FreeMyApps as their go-to platform for interacting and engaging with the hottest new apps,” said Glenn Kiladis, the vice president and general manager of FreeMyApps. “By rewarding users for deep, in-app actions — rather than downloads alone — the new and improved FMA platform enables us to incentivize and drive increased value for our app-publishing clients on the industry’s largest discovery network. ”
Fiksu is venture-backed by Qualcomm Ventures and Charles River Ventures.
