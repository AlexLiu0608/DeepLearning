Are you constantly pulling at your bra straps? Feel uncomfortable wearing tight-fitting tops? Roughly 80 percent of women are wearing the wrong-size bra, according to recent studies.
That’s a potentially huge market for True&Co , a company founded by two former Microsoft execs. The startup raised $4 million in funding today to banish measuring tape and fitting rooms for good.
Getting fitted for a bra is an awkward moment for most women, especially for teens and preteens. Matronly shop assistants peering at you in your underwear, while you jump up and down in a poorly-fitting bra, is not appealing. True&Co’s founder Michelle Lam wants to use cutting-edge technology to put an end to this situation.
Women who are using the online service for the first time will be directed to the “ get fitted ” tab. They are prompted to take a quiz, and answer questions about the comfort and fit of existing bras. Once you’ve been virtually fitted, True&Co provides a personalized home try-on kit with free shipping and returns.
True&Co will use the funding to improve its “fit algorithm.” To increase the accuracy of its tech, the company recruited Brian Emmett , who was previously the director of engineering at Netflix, as its CTO. Similarly to Netflix, the algorithm suggests bras that women might like, based on their previous shopping habits.
True&Co isn’t the only company that is using technology to help women find the right fit. HerRoom also offers a bra-fitting service, and MaidenForm is building out its tech. But True&Co’s website is the best designed of the bunch, and it makes lingerie and bra shopping seem like a more pleasant experience.
The company secured its funding from Crosslink, VegasTechFund (managed by Zappos chief executive Tony Hsieh), Great Oaks Venture Capital and Silicon Valley angel investor Pejman Nozad.
True&Co is based in San Francisco and New York, and currently has 20 employees.
