Victoria’s Secret, Swarovski, and 3D printing marketplace Shapeways have joined forces to give Victoria’s Secret models their 3D printed angel’s wings.
The wings were designed by architect — not designer — Bradley Rothenberg, who first 3D-scanned Victoria’s Secret model Lindsay Ellingson to ensure they will precisely conform to her shape. Shapeways then 3D-printed Rothenberg’s filigreed snowflake wings, which were finally encrusted with “millions” of Swarovski crystals.
“Shapeways’ 3D printing technology brings an unprecedented design element to the famed Victoria’s Secret wings, showing the immense opportunity 3D printing brings to creating beautiful, customizable items,” Shapeways CEO Peter Weijmarshausen said in a statement. “This partnership helps push the boundaries and show what’s possible for the 3D printing industry, within fashion and beyond.”
Today, it’s a model getting a custom outfit. Tomorrow, of course, that could be you or me.
The interesting part about that isn’t only that we’ll get more unique clothing that fits better, but also that 3D printing is democratizing the process of making clothing and opening up the fashion world to non-traditional “designers.”
And allowing designers to give their imaginations free reign:
