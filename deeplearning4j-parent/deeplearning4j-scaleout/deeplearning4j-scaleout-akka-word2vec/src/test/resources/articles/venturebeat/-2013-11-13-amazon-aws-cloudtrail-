As apps on Amazon Web Services (AWS) become increasingly complex and integrated, AWS API calls come from more places and people. It can get confusing — and tracking all that information can be valuable for compliance aid, security analytics, operational troubleshooting, and resource life cycle tracking.
To help developers and IT follow it all, Amazon just unveiled AWS CloudTrail , which records calls made to the AWS APIs and publishes the resulting log files (in JSON format) to a storage bucket in AWS S3, Amazon Web Services’ cloud storage offering.
CloudTrail lets you keep track of what actions users have taken over a specific period of time and of which users have accessed a specific resource. You can also see the source IP address of that activity.
There’s no special charge for CloudTrail, just regular S3 and SNS (Simple Notification Service) pricing.
Amazon made a fun flow chart to demonstrate where CloudTrail fits in the AWS ecosystem. You can check that out below.
