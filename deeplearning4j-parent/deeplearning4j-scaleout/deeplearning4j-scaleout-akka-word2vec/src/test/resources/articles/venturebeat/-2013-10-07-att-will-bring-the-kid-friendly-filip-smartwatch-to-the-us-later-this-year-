Kid-friendly smartwatch Filip finally has its carrier partner — AT&T.
While the Filip smartwatch can do a lot, probably its most interesting feature is that it can function as a standalone phone. That’s something not even Samsung can claim for its Galaxy Gear, which requires a smartphone in order to be even remotely useful.
In addition to voice calling, the Filip offers location tracking, a one-button emergency reporting system, and even one-way text messaging.
“This is the first time such a sophisticated piece of tech was created just for a child,”  Filip CEO Jonathan Peachy told us back in July .
With the AT&T deal, Filip will become the first wearable locator of its kind to be distributed by a major network carrier. AT&T plans to sell the device online in time for the holiday season this year, and in stores next year.
“With its extensive wireless coverage, commitment to innovation and top J.D. Power ranking for customer care, AT&T is the ideal network provider to bring Filip to the U.S. market,” Peachy said in a statement emailed to VentureBeat.
AT&T says the Filip fits perfectly within the vision for its emerging devices unit, which is focused on growing the company’s wireless penetration via new distribution models and devices.
Unfortunately, pricing information is still scarce for both the Filip and whatever service plan AT&T plans to offer alongside it, but you can sign up for updates via Filip’s website .
