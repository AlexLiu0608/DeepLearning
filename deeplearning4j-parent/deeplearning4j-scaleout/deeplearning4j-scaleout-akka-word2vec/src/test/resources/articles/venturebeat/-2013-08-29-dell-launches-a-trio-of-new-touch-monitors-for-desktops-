Touch is invading everything, even the desktop monitor. Dell is proving this point with a trio of new touchscreen monitors for desktops today.
The products include the Dell 20 Touch Monitor, the Dell 23 Touch Monitor, and the Dell 27 Touch Monitor. They offer the natural and intuitive interface of a multi-touch screen with high-definition resolution, and it makes sense to have a touchscreen if you’re using a Windows 8 operating system with the touch-oriented Metro interface. The good thing about using touch on a desktop monitor is that it doesn’t sway or shake when you press down on a screen. (That happens a lot with laptops with flimsy screens).
The screens are also compatible with networking technologies such as MHL, DisplayPort, HDMI, VGA, and USB ports. You can tap, slide, swipe, turn, pinch, and stretch images on the screen when used with a Windows 8 computer.
The Dell 20 Touch Monitor will sell for $250 and come with a resolution of 1,600 x 900 pixels on a 19.5-inch screen. It has a fast 2 millisecond response time and a high dynamic contrast ratio of 8 million:1. That means it will be good for watching action videos and movies. The 23-inch will sell for $450, and the 27-inch will sell for $700.
The monitors are designed so that the glass reaches the edge of the monitor, and they have a wide, 178-degree viewing angle. The stand can tilt up to 60 degrees. The monitors are available now in the U.S. The 20-inch will be available in Europe and Asia on Sept. 26, while the 23-inch and 27-inch monitors will be available on Sept. 18.
