During today’s Yahoo call, CEO Marissa Mayer noted that pageviews, traffic, and users are all up — a good sign for a company struggling to regain its footing.
Yahoo, said Mayer, has “never in its history had 800 million monthly active users.”
The CEO also stated that the company’s traffic is at a two-year high — and that doesn’t count Tumblr traffic.
The best news of all is the 390 million monthly active users Yahoo can claim after a concentrated focus on mobile . That’s more than twice Twitter’s MAUs (161 million) and nearly half of Facebook’s tally of 819 million mobile MAUs.
“We are particularly proud of these numbers,” said Mayer
These types of metrics are a bright spot in what was otherwise a predictably disappointing Q3. Despite the company’s userbase growth and focus on mobile, both revenues and the company war chest experienced serious year-over-year losses.
Of course, more eyeballs means (Yahoo hopes) more opportunity to target and sell ads. More ads means more revenue. We’ll see how well that flow holds true as Yahoo continues its push into the modern web.
