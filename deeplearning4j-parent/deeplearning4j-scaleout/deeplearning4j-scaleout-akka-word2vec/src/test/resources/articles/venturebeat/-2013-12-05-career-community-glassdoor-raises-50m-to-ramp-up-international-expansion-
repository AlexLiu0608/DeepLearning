Best known for its insightful reports on company cultures, Glassdoor announced today that it has raised an additional $50 million to accelerate its global expansion for job seekers.
Glassdoor has built its business by breaking through the wall that usually separates internal company culture from the public eye. It lets company employees anonymously dish on normally private details like the effectiveness of their CEO and their salaries, which ultimately helps job seekers determine if the company is a right fit for them.
With the new funding, the company says it will expand its job listings and recruitment platform worldwide. It also plans to hire 100 new employees over the next year, on top of the 200 employees it already has.
Sausalito, California-based Glassdoor says it has more than 22 million members now, as well as custom data on more than 300,000 companies. The company already sees around 25 percent of its traffic coming from outside the U.S., and it notes that around 35 percent of its traffic comes from mobile devices.
The company has brought an entirely new level of transparency to the job seeking process, and it’ll be interesting to see how international companies react to being scrutinized by their own employees (especially in slightly more traditional countries). Glassdoor says it has more than 1,400 corporate clients, including Facebook and Walmart, and it has 15,000 free employer accounts (which gives companies basic analytics).
The new funding, led by Tiger Global Management, brings Glassdoor’s total venture capital to almost $93 million. New investor Dragoneer Investment Group also participated in the round, along with existing investors Battery Ventures, Benchmark Capital, DAG Ventures, and Sutter Hill Ventures.
