Amazon, like any device maker, has one big mission: to sell as many devices as possible.
To that end, the company is now offering a nine-month payment plan for the Kindle Fire HDX , which runs for $230 and $380. More, Amazon is offering the plan completely interest-free, something that very few companies besides Amazon would even consider doing.
Which leads to one question: What happens when you don’t pay up? Here’s Amazon’s response:
If we are not able to charge any payment to a card on file in your Amazon.com account, our remedies will include the right to deregister your Kindle Fire HDX device, which will block your ability to access Amazon content from your Kindle Fire HDX device, and suspend or terminate your Amazon.com account. You agree that we and our affiliates have no liability related to the exercise of these remedies.
In other words, not paying Amazon what it’s owed means that Amazon can make it impossible for you to get anymore content onto your device, and the company can even prevent you from accessing content you’ve already bought. That’s a pretty good incentive for you to pay up.
While the move is a good sign that Amazon is serious about moving more devices (which leads to Amazon’s real goal of more content sales), the payment plans can also be read another way: Perhaps, despite what it has said , Amazon just isn’t selling as many Kindle Fire HDX units as it would like, and this is just an easy way to boost sales.
The only people who know whether or not that’s the case work for Amazon. Everyone else, including Amazon’s investors, can only speculate, which I assume is exactly how Jeff Bezos likes it.
