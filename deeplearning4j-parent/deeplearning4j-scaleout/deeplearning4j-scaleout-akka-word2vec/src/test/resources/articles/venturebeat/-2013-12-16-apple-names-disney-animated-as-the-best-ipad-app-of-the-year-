How do you stand out from the nearly 1 million apps on Appleâ€™s App Store? Make an animated toolbox featuring decades of Disney art.
Apple named Disney Animated as the iPad app of the year for 2013.
The award is highlights the rise of brands on mobile and the need to do something unique to stand out among the 998,919 apps on the Apple iTunes App Store.
Disney Animated is a premium $9.99 iPad app which gives fans access to animated character assets including text, art, sound, images, interviews, and interactive activities. The assets span all of Walt Disney Animation Studios history, with many of the assets previously unavailable to the public.
Disney bills the app as a convergence of art and technology that helps kids and adults create their own animated movies. Disney has its advantages, but the award is important, as its app was selected from 100,000 iPad apps that launched in 2013.
The app was a joint project of Disney Interactive, Walt Disney Animation Studios, and developer Touch Press.
