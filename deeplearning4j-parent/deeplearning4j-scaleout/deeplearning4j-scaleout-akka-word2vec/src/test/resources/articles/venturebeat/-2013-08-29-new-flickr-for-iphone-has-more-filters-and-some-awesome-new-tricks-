For the smartphone shutterbugs out there, Yahoo is rolling out some fresh hotness. The new Flickr app for iOS  not only gives you a handful of sweet new filters, it also lets you customize the filters and make them all your own. And it features something the Flickr team calls a “Live Preview.”
In Live Preview mode, you can see the filter applied to whatever your camera’s pointed at before you press the shutter button. This way, you can decide which filter looks best before taking the photo.
Also in today’s launch, you’ll find new camera features such as a handy grid, focus and exposure locks, and pinch-to-zoom. Editing features now include tools like sharpening, color balancing, and levels.
You also might notice some elegant new animations and transitions within the app.
Here’s what it all looks like:
