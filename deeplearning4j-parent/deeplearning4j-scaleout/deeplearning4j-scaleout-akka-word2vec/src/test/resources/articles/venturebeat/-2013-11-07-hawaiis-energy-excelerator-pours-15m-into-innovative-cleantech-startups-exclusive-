Hawaii is on a mission to achieve a 70 percent clean energy goal in 2030, making it the ideal testing-ground for green tech startups.
A new startup program, called Energy Exceletor , recently raised $30 million from the U.S. Department of Defense’s Office of Naval Research to help the state achieve that goal. A portion of the funds — about $5 million — have already been invested in 15 innovative companies, the founders exclusively revealed to VentureBeat.
The program typically invests between $100,000 and $1 million per startup, which should be a boon for cleantech companies during a prolonged funding dry spell.
Energy Excelerator is specifically looking to fund new transportation, renewable energy and smart grid technologies. About 200 startups applied this year for the program; eight seed stage and seven growth stage companies were selected.
By phone, cofounder Dawn Lippert said she chose Honolulu as the headquarters for the accelerator, in part due to the natural resources.
“We have ideal test bed conditions — sun, wind, hydro and geothermal,” she said.
Lippert believes that a huge market opportunity exists for cleantech, but startups are held back by the lack of available capital.
Many venture capital firms are wary, as the sector has experienced intense highs and lows in the past several decades. Firms like Kleiner Perkins poured funding into renewable energy startups in the early 2000′s, only to regret see many of their investments go bankrupt. Cleantech took a further dramatic turn for the worse after the financial crisis, due in part to competition from China and a rise in the production of abundant natural gas at home.
Lippert hopes that the next generation of startups can succeed with access to strategic capital and mentorship. Executives at the later-stage companies in the program will offer guidance to less experienced entrepreneurs. In addition, the company is working with a slew of partners and potential corporate customers, including the U.S. Department of Energy.
The program only takes one percent in equity in exchange for funding, which is a relatively small sum compared to most accelerator programs. For reference, Y Combinator takes roughly six percent.
The startups who receive funding can choose to relocate to Hawaii for the program, but many spend up to six weeks on the island. Not bad!
