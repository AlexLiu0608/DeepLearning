GamesBeat readers have spoken: Apple devices and next-generation consoles are hot. Microconsoles and handhelds? Not.
Over a hundred people, including game developers, CEOs, and other tech industry leaders, took part in a recent GamesBeat poll on emerging game technologies. We wanted to know what products and services excite you the most as we head into 2014. The survey was commissioned in advance of the GamesBeat 2013 game conference on Oct. 29 and Oct. 30 in Redwood City, Calif.
Unsurprisingly, the next generation gaming consoles were favorites. Sixty-six percent of people polled said they’d recommend Microsoft’s Xbox One to others, while 76 percent said they’d recommend Sony’s PlayStation 4. Nintendo’s Wii U, however, was favored by only 27 percent.
Apple devices were popular among readers. Seventy-five percent recommended the iPad and 66 percent recommended the new iPhone 5S.
“iPad, especially iPad-Mini, will become the world’s dominate gaming platform over the next two years,” predicts Thor Alexander, CEO of mobile game developer Lucky Puppy Games.
Other handheld gaming devices didn’t fare as well; 42 percent of those surveyed said they’d recommend the Nintendo 3DS, while 34 percent gave the thumbs up to the PlayStation Vita. Only 10 percent of readers favored the Moga controller, while 34 percent liked Nvidia’s Shield.
Microconsoles are also not feeling the love. Only 34 percent of voters said they’d recommend the Android-based Ouya to others, 19 percent said they’d recommend the GameStick, and 9 percent said they’d recommend the Xi3 Corporation’s Piston.
One new console that does have readers’ attention, however, is the Steam Machine. Sixty percent said they’d recommend Valve’s new hardware to others. Dealzon director of marketing Viet Do also noted digital distribution service Steam’s importance, calling it the “de facto” place to store your PC gaming collection.
“We’ve seen many instances where PC gamers avoid buying a game, even if it’s decisively cheaper, simply because it can’t be activated on Steam,” he writes. “Or, they avoid buying from a separate retailer — even though it’s a Steam key — simply because of the perceived inconvenience or hassle.
“One clear thing is happening: there will be more gamers buying digital copies — a game key — vs. traditional physical copies as broadband service ramps up speed and the next-gen consoles offer an even more seamless experience.”
Other notable technologies favored by readers were motion controllers, virtual reality peripherals like the Oculus Rift, and game development platforms such as Unity 3D and Lanica. Virtual reality was favored by 66 percent of gamers, while 81 percent favored motion controls. Oculus VR got a 69 percent favorable rating, while Microsoft’s Kinect got a 67 percent rating.
