Always wanted to drive a Tesla Model S? Well, now you can now rent one.
The wonder car from Tesla Motors will be offered for rental from Hertz in (very) select U.S. markets as part of the company’s “Dream Cars” program.
Right now, the Model S all-electric luxury sedan is only available at San Francisco and Los Angeles airports.
Renters will get the top Model S Performance with an 85-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack and 301-kilowatt (416 horsepower) electric motor.
This version of the Model S will do 0 to 60 mph in 4.2 seconds, has an EPA-rated range of 265 miles, and gets 89 MPGe combined (88 MPGe city, 90 MPGe highway).
The Model S won’t be a regular rental option, though. It will be offered through Hertz’s Dream Cars program, which also includes exotic cars from Aston Martin, Ferrari, and Lamborghini.
Hertz had previously offered the Tesla Roadster as a rental through the program.
For more proletarian electric-car drivers, there are other options.
Hertz has rented plug-in electric cars since 2010, including the Chevrolet Volt and Nissan Leaf. It actually announced plans to rent electric cars before either model went on sale.
Earlier this year, it added a Volt to the University of Connecticut’s car-sharing fleet , and it’s been working to rent electric cars in New York City.
Other companies have had a go at renting electric cars, albeit not always with the success of Hertz.
Car2Go has been doing short term rentals of the Smart ForTwo Electric Drive in San Diego since last year, while Enterprise hasn’t had much success getting drivers into its Nissan Leafs.
