The duo didn’t start off wanting to do a messaging app. In fact, they wanted not to. Because, after all, you want your assistant to be part of everything you do, not just in one app, and not just in a messaging app that will have to compete with dozens of other top messaging apps that are already topping the Google Play leaderboard on a monthly basis.
But essentially, they were forced to.
“You can’t just build a plugin for most of these services,” Feldman says.
What the team did do was architect a solution that does not require — as many messaging apps do — that your friends belong to the same network as you do, which is a great competitive moat when your app is a leading contender with plenty of users, but awful when you’re a startup. Instead, Emu works even if just one of the parties has it, which is sheer genius — born, naturally, of necessity.
“You don’t have to use Emu to get the benefit of the app,” Feldman says. “I can use it, I don’t have to tell my friends, and it doesn’t spam my friends.”
Clearly the team has something interesting here. Not only are both cofounders all-stars, the startup has received $1.5 seed funding from an all-star list of VCs: Kleiner Perkins, TriplePoint Capital, Menlo Ventures, and DFJ. Yes, you just read “seed funding” and “Kleiner Perkins” in the same sentence — typically, Kleiner would not get involved in anything so early, so small.
But there’s something interesting here, and it could get a lot bigger than just a messaging app. In fact, that’s the vision of the team.
“First we have to prove we have something,” Feldman says. “If we become interesting, then there’s all kinds of interesting conversations we can have.”
That’s in the messaging world, certainly, and with the messaging titans of the market. But it’s also likely in other apps as well … helping them all to be smart, to know what we’re saying, and to know how to help us intelligently.
