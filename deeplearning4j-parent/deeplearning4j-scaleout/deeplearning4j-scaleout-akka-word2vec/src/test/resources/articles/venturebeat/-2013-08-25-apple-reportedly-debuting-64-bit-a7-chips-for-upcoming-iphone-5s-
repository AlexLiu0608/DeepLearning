Apple is reportedly going to debut a new A7 processor with its iPhone 5S that is expected to be announced on Sept. 10.
Clayton Morris, an anchor at Fox News Channel said on Twitter   that the A7 processor is running about 31 percent faster than the existing iPhone 5′s A6 processor. The A7 processor is expected to operate on 64-bit code and will have two brains known as cores. The A6 is also a dual-core chip.
The 64-bit part could be a big differentiator for Apple, as that could open up new doors for the technology. ARM and its licensees are working on 64-bit chips to work on a broader set of applications and to move the technology into web-connected data centers.
9TO5Mac reported that it is unclear if 64-bit will make the cut, but it has been in testing. It could be used to get the iPhone 5S to make animations, transparencies, and get graphics to run more smoothly. The upcoming fifth-generation iPad will likely get the same chip, the publication said. Morris also said the iPhone 5S will have a new dedicated chip for motion tracking, which could go with a camera upgrade.
Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said recently that the move to 64-bit processors will happen soon. The iPhone 5S is expected to include a fingerprint sensor, with authentication happening by pressing the Home button down. That feature would be pretty cool. As we previously reported , the iPhone 5 is expected to have a gold color option.
