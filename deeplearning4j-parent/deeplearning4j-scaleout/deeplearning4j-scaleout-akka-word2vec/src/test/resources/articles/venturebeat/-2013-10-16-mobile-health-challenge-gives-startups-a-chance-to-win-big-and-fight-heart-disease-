For the last two years, we have watched mobile overtake, reinvent, and completely upend several industries … from retail to gaming to even newly minted social networks. BrandGarage has helped Fortune 500 brands work with startups and developers to drive innovation in their categories. Later this month, we will host Novartis Pharmaceuticals as it invites some of the best and brightest startups and developers to join their Mobile Health Challenge  (Oct. 25-Oct. 27).
Mobile is again reinventing traditional industries, and health care is seeing a burgeoning number of startups. Tackling health makes a lot of sense. Every chronic disease is essentially a big data challenge. Mobile is a prime platform for addressing the many complex layers of managing chronic illnesses. Mobile devices and wearables offer an ideal platform for collecting information, both actively and passively.  For many chronically ill patients, their care is distributed among a network of caregivers and the complexity of their care requires coordination and real-time monitoring.
Later this month, Novartis Pharmaceuticals tackles the issue of Heart Failure and invites the tech community to work with its executives to build mobile applications that enable caregivers to better monitor and take care of their loved ones with a highly debilitating chronic illness. Heart disease is the leading cause of death and hospitalization in the U.S.  Novartis’s event provides an incredible opportunity to help more startups succeed by building products and services businesses will actually adopt.
See below for event details and the opportunity to make a big difference in people’s life through health-related mobile technology.

The challenge
Create a mobile solution that helps caregivers of loved ones affected by Heart Failure regain control over their lives and provide more effective daily care.
Heart failure overview
Heart failure (HF) is not the literal failing of the heart, but rather its deterioration over time due to the inability to pump enough blood and oxygen to support other organs. Every 30 seconds, someone in the U.S. is hospitalized for HF.
Heart failure typically affects people at an average age of 65 and impacts their lives in widespread ways, from managing their diet and exercise in entirely new ways to sticking to a strict medicine schedule. This often uproots the lives of patients, and that burden is often equally felt by the caregiver, who is suddenly in a new role with lots of responsibility and little idea where to start.
Caregivers are responsible for the care of a loved one who is afflicted by some form of chronic illness. Caregivers come in many forms – wives/husbands, sons/daughters as well as certain health care professionals.
