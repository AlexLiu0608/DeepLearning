Two of Japan’s largest manufacturers of television sets, Sony and Panasonic, have reportedly ended a deal that would see the companies work together on producing organic light-emitting diode displays (OLEDs), according to a Wall Street Journal report that cites anonymous sources.
The two companies forged the partnership about 18 months ago in the hope that sharing technologies would help drive down production costs on OLED screens, which are smaller and offer better image quality than current liquid crystal displays. Neither side was apparently able to lower costs, but they did manage to speed up production time, according to the report.
An end to the OLED partnership doesn’t necessarily mean the two companies are finished working together. Nikkei is reporting that Sony and Panasonic could work on developing newer ultra high-definition TVs (with 4K resolution). The companies could possibly announce something at this year’s CES show, which is just weeks away.
