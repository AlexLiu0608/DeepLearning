In keeping with its plan to dominate the crap out of rival music services , Spotify is rolling out an update to its desktop applications that spruces up the user interface design.
The move is likely just another step by the company to ensure it stays competitive with others. (I, for one, have always preferred Rdio’s web-based interface to Spotify on the desktop).
The desktop app updates for Mac and Windows include a darker UI and a revised take on musician artwork that is now cropped as circles. Most of the changes appear to be purely cosmetic, with no new features added this time around.
Spotify also rolled out a tweaked version of its Android app as well, which features an updated login page and a few changes to how artists are displayed.
The updated apps should be rolling out now to all users.
