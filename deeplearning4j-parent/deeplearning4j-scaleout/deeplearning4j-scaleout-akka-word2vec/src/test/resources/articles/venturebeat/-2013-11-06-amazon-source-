With the holiday season fast approaching, Amazon is rolling out a new initiative that would allow people to purchase its line of Kindle tablets and e-readers at independent bookstores across the country.
The move comes after major retailers like Walmart and Target decided to yank their Kindle displays from brick and mortar stores and cease selling the devices altogether. We previously speculated that this could be a huge blow to Amazon in the long run, so we’re not surprised to see the company searching for relevant showrooms headed into the winter shopping months.
The new initiative, called Amazon Source , is offering retailers something pretty attractive in return for selling those Kindles. Amazon said it will give each participating retailer a 10 percent cut off of all future e-book purchases made on the device, and that’s in addition to making money off of the Kindles and Kindle accessories.
“We believe that retailers, online or offline, small or large, should be striving to offer customers what they want — and many customers want to read both digital and print books,” said Amazon Kindle vice president Russ Grandinetti in a statement.
The move isn’t restricted to independent book stores, meaning Target and Walmart are also eligible should they decide to put Kindles back in retail locations for sale.
