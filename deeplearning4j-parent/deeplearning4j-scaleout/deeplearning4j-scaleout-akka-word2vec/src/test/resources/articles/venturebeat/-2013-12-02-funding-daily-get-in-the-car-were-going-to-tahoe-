This is that jolly time of the year when VCs, developers, designers, and pretty much everyone in the San Francisco startup scene except for marketing and PR people packs up and ships out to the tony wilds of Lake Tahoe.
In cabins and lodges, our Startuplandians are coding, “team building,” and drinking to the brink of oblivion and over its inky precipice.
Yeah. Lots of whiskey there.
Some will stay for a long weekend of snowbunny merriment with family and friends. Others will hunker down for a month or so of Real World: Nerd Tahoe with coworkers.
So here’s what we’ve got for today: A relatively trim trio of deals between deserving startups and profit-chasing venture capital firms. Hooray!
Stem raises $15M
In its second round of institutional funding, energy storage startup Stem has taken in a cool $15 million. Headquartered in Millbrae, Calif., Stem makes systems that help businesses to operate more efficiently in terms of energy usage — and all without making changes in their day-to-day operations. “Stem is a company to keep an eye on as their combination of sophisticated predictive analytics and machine learning applied to energy storage will provide incredible cost savings for customers and businesses,” said a GE Ventures exec in a statement on the funding.
Swarm raises $3M
Swarm Mobile believes that brick and mortar retailers lack insights about how consumers are moving through their stores. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC), the San Francisco-based startup has raised just under $3.5 million in its first round of funding to do just that. Swarm’s team, which is primarily comprised of developers and former digital marketing execs, has developed technology to track customers in-store through their smartphones.
Eventifier takes a rumored half-million seed round
“India’s Eventifier, the startup that archives your events has concluded a financing round for an undisclosed sum from KAE Capital and Chennai-based incubator The Startup Centre. The startup tracks the content of events by collecting posts using the events’ official hashtags across major social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.

The startup charges from $19 onwards depending on the event’s archiving requirements.” Read the full story on Yahoo News .
