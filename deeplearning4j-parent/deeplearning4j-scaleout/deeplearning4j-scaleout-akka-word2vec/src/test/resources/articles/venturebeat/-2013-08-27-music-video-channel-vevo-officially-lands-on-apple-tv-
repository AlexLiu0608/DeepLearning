Popular music video service Vevo announced today that it’s available on Apple TV . The news comes after rumors of a launch emerged last week,
The app brings Vevo’s more than 75,000 music videos, as well as live concerts and events, to Apple’s long-neglected set top box. In recent months, we’ve finally seen more apps hit Apple TV, like HBO Go and ESPN , a sign that Apple is finally ready to pay attention to the living room.
For the most part, the Vevo app looks like just about every other Apple TV app right now: Its main page highlights new and interesting videos, and search function helps you find specific videos. You can also create playlists of videos without much hassle by signing in with your Vevo account.
In my brief testing of the Vevo Apple TV app this morning, videos loaded quickly and in crisp high-definition. (It’s just too bad I gave up on music videos many years ago.)
Vevo is a joint venture between Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group, and Google (which recently  invested a reported $50 million in the site). It launched in 2009 with the goal of becoming the de facto online destination for music videos. It was initially a way to counteract unauthorized music videos on YouTube (now many of Vevo’s videos are also available on YouTube).
Vevo already has apps on Roku’s set top boxes, the Xbox 360, and mobile platforms. The company seems to be following Netflix’s tactic of getting itself on as many platforms as possible, even as its fate seems tied closer to Google’s.
