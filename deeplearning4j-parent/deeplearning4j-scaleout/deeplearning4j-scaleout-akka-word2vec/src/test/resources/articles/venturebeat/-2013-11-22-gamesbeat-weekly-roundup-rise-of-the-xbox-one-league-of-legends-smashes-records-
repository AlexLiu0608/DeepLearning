We’ve had a busy week at GamesBeat thanks largely to the launches of the new consoles, the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. We’ve done a ton of coverage all week, including an in-depth look at the Xbox One controller and tons of reviews for Microsoft’s new system.
Of course, the rest of the gaming world has also kept busy. We’ve heard rumblings that Nintendo plans to make an educational-based tablet. Meanwhile, the popular free-to-play, highly competitive League of Legends was breaking streaming records.
It’s all here — and much, much more — in this weekly roundup of GamesBeat’s best stories.
Next-gen (or is it the current gen now?)
