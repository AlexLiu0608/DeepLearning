Update: Akrham Origins is now released! Best deal is still $37.50 but you won’t be getting the Deathstroke DLC. Use coupon GMG25-3P6V5-3Q850 (expires 10/28 at 11am ET).
Tomorrow marks the release of Batman: Arkham Origins , but in Adam West fashion, you’re able to POW! BANG! SLAM! the PC download price tag from $49.99 to $37.50 at Green Man Gaming. The UK digital retailer has a 25% off coupon code – a solid discount for the day before release. Preorders also include the bonus Deathstroke DLC pack. You’ll have to act fast, though, as the coupon dies tomorrow at 11AM Eastern with no extension in site.
The same coupon also works on tomorrow’s release of Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst, dropping the Steam key from $39.99 to $30. The console version of the game came out earlier on Tuesday, and you’ll already find a discount at Amazon. They dropped the price to $30.99 for the PS3 and to $35.99 for the 360 (normally $40).
If you’re looking for a good deal on the upcoming FPS games COD: Ghosts and BF4, Dell Home has an attractive offer. For PC, Xbox 360, Xbox ONE, PS3, and PS4 versions of both games, they’re throwing in a sizable $25 eGift card as a preorder bonus. The bonus gift card arrives via email 10-20 days after the game’s release, carries a 90 day expiration and is good towards any purchase on Dell.com.
