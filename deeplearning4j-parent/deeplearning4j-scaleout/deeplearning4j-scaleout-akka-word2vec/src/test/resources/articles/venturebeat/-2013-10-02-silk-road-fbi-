The FBI seized Bitcoin-powered Silk Road today after a lengthy investigation into the reputed drug marketplace and its founder.
Authorities believe a 29-year-old San Francisco-based man named Ross Ulbricht ran Silk Road, which allegedly brought in millions of dollars from a number of often sketchy, illegal transactions. If you visit the website today, you will find a seizure notice from the FBI.
Ulbricht allegedly went by the name of Dread Pirate Roberts on Silk Road, according to the indictment , which was found by investigative journalist Brian Krebs. The indictment charges Ulbricht with narcotics trafficking conspiracy, computer hacking conspiracy, and money-laundering conspiracy. He is said to have made $79.8 million in commissions from the website while Silk Road overall did $1.2 billion in sales.
Christopher Tarbell, an undercover FBI agent, cracked Dread Pirate Roberts’ identity while using Silk Road himself — even making some transactions of his own.
The Silk Road was based on the Tor Network, a “dark place” on the Internet where people go to conceal their identities. Criminals use it, but it’s also used for a number of legitimate purposes, such as by journalists to conceal sources. It was set up like a normal marketplace, according to Tarbell, though it used Bitcoin, which has since tanked in value.
