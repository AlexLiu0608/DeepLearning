How much of the expected $131 billion spend will your cloud startup take this year?
The opportunity is there but the odds of failure are stacked against the growth hacker, marketing professional, or as I like to call it, the “Chief Noise Maker.”  Building a great company isn’t easy, especially when your budget is stretched or practically doesn’t exist.
Hopefully that’s because your R&D team is humming away at developing a kick-ass application.
But that doesn’t mean that you should kick the can around the office.  Finding the right free and cost effective tools are crucial in accelerating your marketing efforts in a short amount of time. Here are five must-have innovative tools for those that are looking to scale their marketing objectives.
MailChimp
Nothing beats the measurement and attribution capabilities for multiple lists for the price. Your startup more than likely doesn’t overkill nurturing capabilities that expensive solutions have. Use third-party integrations with SalesForce to associate email campaigns with lifecycle and behavior groups of your users/customers.
Rapportive
Know everything about a potential partner from a pane in Gmail.  Instant connectivity to Facebook, LinkedIn, and Crunchbase with contacts is awesome for quick update on partners, customers and prospects. It also makes Gmail a must-have email solution for your business – can you imagine going back to Outlook, Zimbra, or some other client?
Yesware
Did anyone actually read your email? When? Yesware provides updates you when a sent email has been opened. Not only is Yesware addictive, it helps you to understand strategically which emails deliver a true ‘reply’ and plan follow ups more effectively.
Traackr
Finding influencers is important but crafting the right message for engagement is even better. Traackr is an awesome SaaS solution for identifying influencers in specific domains. The company’s “A-List” feature helps to make each engagement with a potential influencer successful with content and keyword analysis.
TweetReach
How can you truly put a KPI on awareness? You can’t, but you can get close. Tweet Reach helps you measure the twitter reach of your blog content and mentions over the internet, while identifying twitter influencers that accelerated its reach.
The absolute worst thing you can do is buy an amazing overkill solution that you need … but not right now. Start simple and rigorously test how those solutions can help lift your current conversion goals.
