It may be down, but it’s not out. Next month, soon-to-be-mobile-deviceless Nokia will unveil half a dozen new mobile devices, if not more. This will probably include at least two of the hit Lumias and maybe some surprises.
The occasion will be the Nokia World event, taking place on Oct. 22 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. According to a report in The Verge , at least six new devices plus new accessories, including a “pretty special” one, will be shown.
The 6-inch Lumia 1520 “phablet” is the likeliest new product, making its debut as the largest-screen smartphone from the company. Some reports say that the 1520 could sport the quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800, a 20 megapixel PureView camera with Zeiss optics, and four mikes for high-end audio recording. Many also expect a smaller version of the 1520, the Nokia 929 HD smartphone.
A Windows RT tablet with the internal codename of Sirius may also make an appearance, which would be the company’s first tablet.
The rumored RT tablet, coming at a time when other manufacturers are abandoning that platform , is expected to have LTE connectivity, a 10.1-inch screen, a keyboard-enhanced cover and a look related to that of its older Lumia Windows Phone siblings.
But what else is in store? The Finnish handset maker has already confided to the world through Twitter that it believes “in technology that brings people closer” and in “technology that grows in leaps and bounds.” Could there be more Asha-based devices? A smartwatch?
