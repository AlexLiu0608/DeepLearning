DevBeat 2013 , our very first developer conference, has zero panels and no “fireside chats.” Instead, we decided to fill the agenda with stuff you can actually use in your daily work.
Take our Master Classes, for example. We arranged for some of the best instructors in the biz to come in and spend an hour teaching you how to get started with new technologies. Node is one of the hottest in this category, so we couldn’t let the opportunity slip by.
Yes, you can come to DevBeat and get up and hacking with Node in about an hour. We’ll give you everything you need to get started, and you’ll also get some truly helpful “homework” to take away from the show.
For the seasoned polyglot, this crash course, taught by Joyent’s training director, will be invaluable.
And for the seasoned polyglot, we’re also giving away a limited number of free tickets .
That link will take you to a survey. Fill out the survey, and you’re in the running to get a free ticket with a $550 face value.
Also at the show: We’ve got Stallman, DHH, Alex Payne, and reps from some of the coolest companies in tech. And we’re doing a hardware hackathon. Register now . Seats are filling up fast!
VentureBeat is creating an index of the most exciting cloud-based services for developers . Take a look at our initial suggestions and  complete the survey  to help us build a definitive index. We’ll publish the official index later this month, and for those who fill out surveys, we’ll send you an expanded report free of charge.  Speak with the analyst who put this survey together to get more in-depth information,  inquire within .
