Want to get your fingers all over a Chromebook without spending an absurd amount of money? Acer’s got your ticket.
The company announced a new version of its latest Chromebook today, C720P, which packs a touchscreen for just $300. In comparison, Google’s Chromebook Pixel , the only previous model with a touchscreen, sells for a whopping $1,300.
The Chromebook initiative has always been about producing low-cost hardware with a slim, web-focused operating system (Chrome OS is basically just Google’s Chrome browser — that’s it), so the C720p makes a lot more sense than the expensive Pixel.
Acer’s new machine comes with an 11.6-inch display, a Celeron processor, 2GB RAM, and 32GB of storage. But really, it’s all about that lovely touchscreen. Google’s Chrome OS still isn’t very touchscreen friendly, but being able to touch the screen should come in handy when lounging with the laptop (it’s a great way to scroll through web pages, for one).
I’m just glad there’s finally another touchscreen Chromebook option than the Pixel, a device that feels more like Google proving to the world it can build MacBook Pro-like hardware than actually producing a useful high-end Chromebook.
Acer’s C720p will be available on Amazon and Best Buy in early December.
