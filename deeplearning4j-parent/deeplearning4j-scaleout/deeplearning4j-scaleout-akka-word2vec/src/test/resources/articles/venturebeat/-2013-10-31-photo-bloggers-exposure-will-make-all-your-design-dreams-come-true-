Exposure is still in a beta period, so invites will be going out in waves and will be available through current beta testers.
“After that, we make a continued effort to turn Exposure into a full-fledged, prime time-ready product,” said Beard. And at that point, we can imagine pro options emerging for paid users (Beard poo-pooed the idea of ads and sponsored content, thank goodness).
Looking broadly at the landscape of online products for self-expression, we can see a few trends. First, everybody has the tools to be a writer or photographer or storyteller or filmmaker. For better or worse, the production means have been democratized. And the price of hardware has only accelerated that process.
“The habit Instagram and Twitter have created of ‘one photo and a tiny description’ per story is kinda toxic to humans’ nature of telling tales,” Beard posited.
“We have an incredible amount of high quality cameras available to pretty much everyone. But 99 percent of the time, people are taking a great quantity of really decent photos to only ever post one or two. It’s a waste of people’s compassion to document their experiences.
“I want Exposure to be a place people can get lost in story after story of incredibly immersive narratives and where authors can create these stories so easily that it inspires them to shoot more frequently and thoughtfully. If we can nail that experience (and I think we have so far) then it will be the go to platform for a lot of people.”
Stay tuned for more on Elepath, the little web/mobile shop that could.
