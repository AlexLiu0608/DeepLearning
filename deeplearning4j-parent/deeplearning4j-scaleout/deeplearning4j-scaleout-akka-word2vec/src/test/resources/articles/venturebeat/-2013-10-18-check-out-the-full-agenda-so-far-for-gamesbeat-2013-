View from the balcony: What’s hot or not? Trends and predictions
Tim Chang and Bing Gordon have been among the most visible investors in disruptive game companies. They have co-invested in companies such as Ngmoco and Ouya. Gaming runs deep in their blood, as Gordon was at Electronic Arts for 25 years and he was a major early investor in Zynga. Chang has invested in companies like Playdom and Lumosity. Chang is looking closely at gamification, or applying game mechanics to non-game applications in fields such as health. Gordon is also looking at the lessons from traditional games and the new territory of social and mobile. We’ll ask them what they think is hot or not in games, and their predictions for its future.

Signs of Maturity in Mobile Gaming
5+ years after its launch, the app store has become a rational place to build a gaming business. One sign of maturity? Market leaders like Rovio rely on traditional marketing strategies and multi-million dollar budgets to build long term franchises. There are still plenty of opportunities for indie game developers to make it big, but they now need to be smarter marketers and business strategists to compete to win. Simon Khalaf will discuss signs of maturity in mobile gaming, look at what the big mobile franchises have done right, and pinpoint what small developers can learn from the Rovios and Imangis of the world when it comes to marketing for long term success even without a studio-sized budget.
