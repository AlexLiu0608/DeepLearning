Apple introduced iTunes Radio to the masses back in June , but the world will finally be able to use it in just a few weeks.
AdAge reports that iTunes Radio will launch in September with a handful of big-name advertisers on hand, including McDonald’s, Nissan, and Pepsi. iTunes Radio will work on iPhones, iPads, desktops, and laptops (including Windows PCs) with iTunes, and Apple TV.
Most likely, the iTunes Radio official launch will coincide with the launch of the latest iPhone, which is apparently set for Sept. 10 . The launch could include the overhyped “gold iPhone.”
The report says there will be three types of ads inside iTunes Radio: audio, video, and display ads that take up the screen of whatever device you’re using. Audio ads will run every 15 minutes, and video ads will run once an hour. Video ads will only run when iTunes Radio predicts you will be looking at the screen, such as when you skip a track or press play.
However, you can dodge these ads entirely. If you subscribe to iTunes Match — which syncs you up you music collection across your devices using iCloud — you will not be subjected to ads in iTunes Radio.
iTunes Radio will compete closely with streaming radio king Pandora as well as ad-supported streaming radio options offered by Spotify, Rdio, and Slacker. Several other music services told us back in June that they weren’t worried about iTunes Radio, but we’ll see how the landscape changes once it actually launches.
