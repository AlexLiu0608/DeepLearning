Apple’s iWork and iLife apps are getting a refresh for both Mac and iOS 7 devices.
At Apple’s media event Tuesday in San Francisco, the company announced new versions of its iLife and iWork apps — all of which will be available today for free (with the purchase of any Mac or iOS device). The refreshed iLife apps include GarageBand, iPhoto, and iMovie, while the new iWork apps are Pages, Numbers, and Keynote.
All of the apps now feature iCloud integration, so you can share documents, files, and projects across the apps regardless of device. And they all have retooled user interfaces.
Apple is bringing new features to iWork for iCloud, the company’s web-based iWork app suite. The Pages app is getting real-time editing features that will enable users to edit documents together simultaneously, bringing the app in-line with Google Docs and other cloud-based editing tools. You “can even collaborate with a friend who is stuck on a PC,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet software and services.
GarageBand is getting a host of new features, including built-in robot drummers named Kyle and Gavin (Siri is swooning). And it now supports 32-track recording. That’s a lot of tracks: Most pro studios record on just 24.
GarageBand was previously a paid download on iOS, but Apple is embracing a freemium model for the new version, charging for additional instruments and sounds.
