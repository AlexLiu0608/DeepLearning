HelloFresh , a Berlin, Germany-based company that aims to make tasty, healthy meals at home as effortless as possible, has nabbed another $7.5 million to boost its market share in the U.S. and elsewhere.
This is the third round of financing for the company, which has now raised a total of $20 million. The Moscow-based VC firm Phenomen led the round, and Vorwerk Ventures and Holtzbrinck Ventures participated. Rocket Internet and Investment AB Kinnevik are existing investors.
We first reported on the company last year . The site lets home cooks choose from up to five new recipes created by professional chefs and nutritionists. The ingredients are then delivered direct to the customer’s door. The recipes take 30 minutes or less to prepare, only require basic kitchen equipment, and come with step-by-step instructions. 
HelloFresh says it now shifts several million meals in its core markets. Since the last funding round in December, the company says it has quadrupled its revenue, and doubled its margins.
