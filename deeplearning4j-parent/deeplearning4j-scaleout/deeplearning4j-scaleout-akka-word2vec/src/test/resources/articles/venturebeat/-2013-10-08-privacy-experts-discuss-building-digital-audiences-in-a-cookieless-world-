Registration is open for “A Morning of Mobile Privacy” presented by the Mobile Leaders Alliance (MLA) and Celtra – scheduled to take place from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Eastern at Humphrey at the Eventi Hotel.
This half-day session will kick off with an original keynote by Jules Polonetsky, the executive director and co-chair of The Future of Privacy Forum, on “Restoring the Faith” — a talk about how mobile companies can avoid privacy pitfalls in an effort to win consumer trust. The morning will also include a special presentation from tenured privacy expert Alan Chapell, the president of Chapell & Associates, where he will discuss the secrets of how brand marketers can build digital audiences in a world without cookies. Discussions to follow with industry luminaries from companies including: BlackBerry, Jumptap, the Application Developers Alliance and Disney.
Whether you’re a media professional, app developer, or technology provider, you’re going to walk away from this morning feeling more confident in your ability to do your job effectively. “The privacy discussion is so huge right now in mobile. It’s more important than ever to stay in front of this topic and ensure you, and your company, are up to speed on the latest standards and regulations,” MLA founder Dan Wittmers said.
