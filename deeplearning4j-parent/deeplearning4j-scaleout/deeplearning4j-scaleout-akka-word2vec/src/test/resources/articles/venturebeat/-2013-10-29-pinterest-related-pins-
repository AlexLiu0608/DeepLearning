Today, Pinterest might have just gotten closer to revealing how its advertising strategy will look.
Pinterest lets you pull images from around the Internet and save them in themed boards that others on the site can follow. The company will now insert “related pins” that it thinks you’ll like in order to help you find new boards and widen your circle on the social site.
It will do this by analyzing the content of your pins. Are you pinning pictures of Halloween decorations? Perhaps you’d like these pictures of babies dressed as candy corn.
Similar to Pandora, you can tell Pinterest whether you like the pin it’s given you and if you want to see more of the same. You can do this by pressing a thumbs up or down button to register your interest.
This could be one step closer to Pinterest’s advertising model, which similarly puts sponsored pins into your stream . This technology, which for now helps you with discovery, might translate into advertising that is personalized, and thus likely successful.
Pinterest is a company brimming with potential not yet met. People spend a lot of time on socials sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest. All three provide ways to share your interests and the things going on in your life, but the mindsets of those using each site are very different.
On Facebook and Twitter, people are there to talk and be social. On Pinterest, however, people are in more of an e-commerce mindset. They’re shopping online and pulling together wishlists, they’re planning future house redesigns, they’re creating their ideal weddings. These people might just be more likely to click on an image that reminds them of their aesthetic and buy it — or plan to buy it.
