Since its November 19th release date, the Xbox One has been in scarce supply at the $499.99 retail price. For those of you who avoided the long lines on Black Friday but still want one in time for Christmas, a new hope has emerged at Best Buy.
This morning Best Buy put five bundles on sale with prices ranging between $529.98 to $649.96. The cheapest is the standard console bundled with a 12 month Xbox LIVE Gold Subscription for $529.99, which is just the $499.99 console price plus $30 for 1 yr. membership. In fact, that puts it at a $30 discount, since an Xbox LIVE membership normally runs $59.99.
The other bundles at Best Buy involve either an extra wireless controller or Call of Duty: Ghosts. Apparently Best Buy has also concluded the Xbox One is generally used as a COD machine.
If you’re not up for the bundle offers, the  Xbox One (console only)  is also now back in stock at Best Buy. As with the bundle offers, you’re limited to one per customer. Store pickup options are not available.
The best part is, shipping is free and with a promised December 24th or sooner arrival date. If you want one sooner, there are expedited and “express” shipping options available, which vary in price depending on how expensive the bundle is. If you go with the standard console (no bundle) the fastest “Express” shipping option will cost $24.99 with an estimated arrival of 12/13-12/16/2013.
Other Places for Xbox One Availability
Amazon: If you’re an Amazon Prime member, you might have been waiting on bated breath for the Xbox One to go back in stock so you get that paid-for “free” 2-day shipping. In truth, Amazon has had them in stock on and off for the past week and you will be likely to see it again before Christmas. As of the time writing, they are out of stock, but for most of the day December 11th the console was in-stock.
GameStop: the nation-wide chain  has an Xbox One bundle in stock for those with cash on hand. Their “exclusive” bundle includes Ryse Son of Rome, Dead Rising 3, Forza 5, and an extra Wireless Controller for $739.95. It’s not cheap, but it still beats paying $750 for the console alone on eBay. While GameStop is promising to ship the units on December 16th, there is no free shipping option.  ”Value shipping” costs $15.50 and will take 5-10 days for transition and then another 2 days for processing (Ick!). If you want to buy from GameStop and get by Christmas you’ll need to bump up that shipping to “Standard” with a cost of $18.50 (only $2 more) where its only 3-5 business days for transit and 1 business day for processing. If you order by the end of the week, you should receive by Christmas (though we think the Best Buy deal is the best price as of writing).
