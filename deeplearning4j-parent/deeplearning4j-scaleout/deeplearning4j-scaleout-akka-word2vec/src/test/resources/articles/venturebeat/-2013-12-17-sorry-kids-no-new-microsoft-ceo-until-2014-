Microsoft provided an update on its search for a new chief executive officer today, and it doesn’t look like the final weeks of 2013 will yield a big announcement.
Microsoft board member John W. Thompson released a blog post today explaining the state of the CEO search. The company announced in August that current CEO Steve Ballmer planned to step down within the following 12 months. This put the board search committee to task to find the successor — Microsoft’s third chief since its founding 38 years ago.
Chairman Bill Gates explained at Microsoft’s shareholder meeting last month that the candidate will need to be able to run a highly technical, complex organization.
Thompson explained that the search committee originally reached out to around 100 people to narrow down the search. After interviewing “dozens” of these potential candidates, the board decided on a pool of 20 people. It has now roped in the entire board to vet these candidates and will continue to narrow down the list.
Certainly, the new CEO will have a lot to work with considering Microsoft’s huge variety of product offerings.
Microsoft hopes to have something to announce by early 2014. The company says it is “determined and confident that the company’s third CEO will lead Microsoft to renewed and continued success.”
