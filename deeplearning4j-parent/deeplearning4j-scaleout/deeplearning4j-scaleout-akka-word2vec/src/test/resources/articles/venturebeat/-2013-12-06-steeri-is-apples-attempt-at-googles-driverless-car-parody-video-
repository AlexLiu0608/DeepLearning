If you’ve ever wondered what it would like if Apple decided to challenge Google’s Driverless car technology, the outcome could be either wonderful or kind of terrifying.
Comedy group The Smart Department decided it would definitely be the latter and created a short video demonstrating the fictitious new Apple app Steeri , which takes everything that’s awful about voice recognition feature Siri and puts it behind the wheel of an automobile.
As you can see in the video embedded below, Steeri automatically senses the computer technology within your car’s internal dashboard and steering, so it can pilot any car for you if you simply click a few buttons and tell your iPhone where you want to go. Whether you get to your destination is another issue entirely.
Check out the video below and let us know your thoughts in the comments.
