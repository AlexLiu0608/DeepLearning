We aimed to get the best speakers we could at GamesBeat 2013. We were fortunate to have more than 50 CEOs among our 100 speakers. A total of 539 people attended, and 365,000 more viewed the proceedings on Twitch. You can view the video archives here.
Our theme this year was the Battle Royal, or the competition that ensues when barriers come down and game companies make the transition from physical to digital or from console to online and social to mobile. We gave our audience a slice of the state of the game business from many different views.
Check out the beautiful pictures taken by Michael O’Donnell for VentureBeat. Each picture has a description of the speaker mentioned. So if you watch our slideshow, you can get a quick glimpse of the content of our best game conference yet. And here’s a link to the stories we wrote from the event. Many thanks to everyone who attended and our sponsors, too.
