We’re looking for an enterprising reporter who can cover cloud technology.
The ideal candidate will have experience reporting on technology to some depth and be genuinely excited about covering the transformative effects that cloud is having on the enterprise and beyond.
We’re focused on New York and San Francisco, but we’re willing to consider reporters outside of those cities as well, if you’ve got the right interests and background.
Most important of all, we want someone who is eager to go out and get the stories that other people don’t have. Do you like talking to people, meeting entrepreneurs, and interviewing product managers and CIOs to find out the intricacies of their technologies? Are you driven to write fast and be first? Do you have a proven track record of getting scoops? Then we want to hear from you.
VentureBeat offers the chance to work with a small team of writers who are committed to journalistic excellence, with lots of hands-on editing support and a great team atmosphere. We offer benefits including health care and stock options. And if you are in New York or San Francisco, our offices are awesome.
If this sounds like the kind of job you’d be excited about, write a note to executive editor Dylan Tweney telling us why you’d be a great choice, and include links to no more than five clips that show your best tech-related newswriting skills. A resume or LinkedIn profile is also helpful to give a sense of your background. Please put “enterprise reporter” in the subject line to ensure that it doesn’t get lost in my inbox.
