Surface 2 The Surface 2 Source: Devindra Hardawar/VentureBeat
Microsoft also upgraded its iconic kickstand in both new Surfaces by giving it another level of adjustment, so you can more easily use the device on your lap. Unfortunately, I couldn’t grab one of the devices to test out their lap comfort levels, but in photos and videos Microsoft has shown they look pretty stable.
I spent most of my time at today’s event with the Surface 2, as most of the Surface Pro 2 units weren’t functional (Microsoft reps say they were mistakenly shipped in a demo only mode). Both devices run Windows 8.1 (the Surface 2 runs the stripped-down Windows RT version), which adds more options for multitasking and brings back the Start button to the traditional Windows desktop.
I also briefly checked out the new Touch Cover 2 and Type Cover 2. The Touch Cover 2 doesn’t have any physical keys, but it feels vastly more responsive than last year’s model. The Type Cover 2 feels a bit thinner and the keys flow nicely. Given just how badly the Touch Cover bombed for me last year and how distractingly clunky the original Type Cover was, I certainly appreciated the changes.
I’ll have to spend more time with the Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2 before I make any final judgments, but at this point I’m intrigued by their improvements as well as their prices ($449 for the Surface 2 and $899 for the Surface Pro 2). Given that they undercut both the iPad and MacBook Air, Microsoft may finally have decent competitors to Apple’s popular gadgets.
Below, check out a brief video of my hands-on (excuse the noise, it was a very crowded event).
