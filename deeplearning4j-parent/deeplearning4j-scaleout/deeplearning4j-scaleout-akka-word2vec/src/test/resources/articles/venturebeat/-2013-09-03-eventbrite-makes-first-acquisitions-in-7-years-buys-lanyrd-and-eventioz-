After 7 years and $135 million, popular online ticketing service  Eventbrite is finally making some acquisitions .
Eventbrite has acquired Lanyrd , a startup that provides a social directory of conferences and other professional events, and Latin American ticketing service Eventioz .
London-based Lanyrd’s database includes thousands of events around the world. You can see what events people in your social and professional networks are attending and/or speaking at, and browse events by topic or location. Users can use Lanyrd to track what’s going on at an event, share their schedule, and find content about the event afterwards.
Eventioz  is active in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. It has worked with more than 15,000 organizers to sell tickets to 20,000 events.
Lanyrd wrote in a blog post this morning that it will continue to operate independently of Eventbrite, but will offer deeper integrations.
“One thing that was very important to us: Eventbrite has no plans to shut Lanyrd down,” the company said. “Our vision for improving events has always been about making events better — for attendees, organisers, speakers, and companies [ …] Eventbrite’s vision sits well with ours.”
Companies and individuals use Eventbrite to sell tickets to events.  The service has processed more than 130 million tickets and sold roughly $1.5 billion in ticket sales . I attend a lot of conferences as a journalist, and almost every time I register, it is through Eventbrite.
205 million attendees participate in the nation’s 1.8 million conventions, conferences, congresses, trade shows, inventive events, and corporate/business meetings. Conventionindustry.org estimates that this amounts to $263 billion in spending, 1.7 million in U.S. jobs, and a total economic output of $907 billion.
The acquisition of Lanyrd will help Eventbrite incorporate a stronger discovery element into its service and add more structure to its data. Eventbrite clients will be able to easily add their events to Lanyrd’s inventory, and Lanyrd users can embed an Eventbrite ticket widget on their event page to directly sell tickets. The goal is to create an organized, searchable database that includes basic information not only about events, but also about speakers, attendees, etc.
The acquisition of Eventioz will help Eventbrite solidify a foothold in Latin America’s rapidly growing Internet economy.
Eventbrite raised a fresh $60 million round of funding earlier this year to expand its international footprint, improve its mobile presence, and hire more talent. Cofounder and CEO Kevin Hartz has stressed again and again that the company will take the journey to an IPO slowly. It has raised a total of $135 million in funding.
Lanyrd participated in Y Combinator in 2011 and received a $1.4 million seed round from UK investors as well as some U.S. angel investors. It was founded by husband and wife team Natalie Downe and Simon Willison. Interestingly, Eventbrite was also cofounded by a husband and wife team — Julia Hartz is Eventbrite’s cofounder and president.
Eventioz is based in Argentina and has raised $1.5 million from Kaszek Ventures.
The amounts of the acquisitions were undisclosed.
