While just about everything seems to be going wrong for BlackBerry at the moment, the company still aims to bring its popular BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) service to its biggest rivals.
A tweet from BlackBerry’s official BBM Twitter account this morning claims it’s “still 100% committed to bringing #BBM to Android and iPhone.” Unfortunately, there’s no word on timing yet.

The announcement follows a disastrous attempt to launch the iPhone and Android BBM apps last weekend. Before BlackBery was able to release its official apps, an early version of its Android app hit the web and immediately overwhelmed its servers. As a result, the company had to delay its official launch and focus on blocking users of the unreleased app.
Right after the BBM launch fiasco, BlackBerry accepted a $4.7 billion buyout offer from Fairfax Financial Holdings, a Canadian firm known for taking on troubled local companies.
BlackBerry had a chance to reinvigorate its brand by launching BBM on other platforms, but now it just seems like another example of how the company can’t do anything right these days.
