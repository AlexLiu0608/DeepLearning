Exciting news! VentureBeat is announcing a new  events package  that will enable you to attend three signature events for a fraction of the price, plus you will be admitted to CloudBeat for free!
With this package, $1,500 will get you in to four of our signature events in total: CloudBeat, plus three more of your choice. That’s a huge discount on the usual per-ticket price.
But you have to act now: This offer is only available until Monday at 12 noon Pacific time.
Our goal at VentureBeat is to unify the tech community through a neutral lens and to identify and showcase standout examples of technology that is transforming business. Each one of our  events  cater to a specific area that we feel is changing how people live, transact and communicate. Whether the focus is mobile, cloud, data, or health, these events are all connected by VentureBeat’s commitment to excellence: We dig deep in to topics, ask the hard questions, and probe for compelling new information to benefit you and the technology community as a whole.
CloudBeat , Sept. 9 – Sept. 10 in San Francisco, is jam-packed with an amazing lineup of speakers. October brings us the Battle Royal at  GamesBeat , a look at the wave of new platforms in gaming today. Take a deep-dive into the latest and greatest developer technologies at  DevBeat  in November. Or maybe you’re hungry for data, analytics, and new trends in data science at  DataBeat  in December.
Thank you for your continued support. We look forward to seeing you at Cloudbeat 2013!
VentureBeat is creating an index of the top 'arms merchants' of the cloud . Take a look at our initial suggestions and  complete the survey  to help us build a definitive index. We’ll publish the official index later this month, and for those who fill out surveys, we’ll send you an expanded report free of charge.
