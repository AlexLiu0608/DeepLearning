The holidays are a hectic time, but we’ve kept busy to deliver another week’s worth of content for you guys. Notably, we’re looking back at 2013′s brightest (and dimmest) games and moments. We also covered Nintendo’s network issues, reviewed the new Walking Dead episode and season from developer Telltale, and more.
