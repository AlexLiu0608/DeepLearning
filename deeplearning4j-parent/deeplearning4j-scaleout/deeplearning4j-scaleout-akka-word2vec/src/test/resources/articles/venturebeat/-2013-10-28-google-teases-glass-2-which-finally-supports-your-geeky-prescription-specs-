Google Glass may soon get an upgrade, if the latest tease from Google is any indication.
Google said today that current Glass Explorers will soon be able to swap their first generation Glass units for a newer, more advanced upgrade. The company says that the update will include a mono earbud and will “work with future lines of shades and prescription frames.”
In other words, Google Glass 2 is a major upgrade, and it isn’t  too far away.
Google says that anyone who purchased a Glass unit before today is eligible for the free upgrade, which will also give them the opportunity to swap colors.
This is the vision for Glass that’s about to become reality.
From the sound of it, the Glass follow-up seems to address two of the bigger concerns leveled at its predecessor. Considering that the current version of Glass doesn’t work with prescription frames, designing the follow-up to do so will vastly expand how many people will be able to use the device down the line.
And that’s exactly what Google wants right now.
Equally significant is the mono ear bud addition, which should satiate those annoyed by the bone conduction tech that Glass offers today.
On the software end, Google has been shipping Glass updates every month, so we can expect the follow-up to come equipped with them by default.
