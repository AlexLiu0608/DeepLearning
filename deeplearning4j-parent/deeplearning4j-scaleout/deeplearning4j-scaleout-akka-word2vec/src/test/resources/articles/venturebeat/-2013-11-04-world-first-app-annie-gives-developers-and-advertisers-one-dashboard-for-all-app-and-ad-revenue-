Not anymore, says App Annie.
“We’re pretty much the first bringing in multiple networks,” App Annie’s Marcos Sanchez told me. “To do an integrated place with multiple platforms … as many as 20, 30, 40 of them … we’re the first to do that. And, most importantly for developers, to integrate that with revenues from your app store sales.”
App Annie has long provided app analytics solutions helping developers understand how well their apps are selling . I have an app on the iOS app store, and trust me, reading Apple’s default analytics is painful and confusing — App Annie makes it simple. The company recently branched into eBook analytics for Amazon, Apple, and Google Play  and is now taking the next logical step: integrating ad network sales data into its monetization dashboards so that you can get a full 360-degree view of all your revenue.
Out of the gate, App Annie supports Google’s AdMob, plus Chartboost, Apple’s iAd, Jumptap, MdotM, Tapit! and Tapjoy, and Sanchez tells me the company’s goal is to support any and all ad networks.
In other words, all your download revenue, all your in-app revenue, all your ad revenue, for all your apps, connected with the data about downloads, geographies, rankings, and reviews, all in one place. There’s no SDK or API to connect to; App Annie works by simply connecting to the app stores and ad networks using your existing credentials, then collates, analyzes, and summarizes all the data.
On the other side, App Annie also helps mobile marketers.
Currently, they might be running concurrent campaigns on five, 10, or even 20 mobile ad networks, each with their own dashboards, metrics, click-through rate, and ROI calculations. App Annie can bring that into a single unified dashboard so you can see everything all at once.
In other words, bye-bye, Excel.
“The idea was similar to what we do with analytics,” Sanchez says. “We’d love to be Switzerland — a neutral place pulling in information from a lot of places, giving you a nice long-tail perspective.”
App Annie is debuting something the company calls the “unified mobile advertising dashboard,” which aggregates all your ad performance data into one place. App developers can use this as well, since they often build and manage mobile user acquisition campaigns, and if they do, App Annie will correlate their costs with their revenue, giving them extremely easy ROI calculation. Advertisers have access to what the company says are 22 new reports, which will allow “rapid analysis” of ad revenues by app, by app store, by ad network, by country, or by campaign, providing both holistic and very fine-grained reporting capability.
“Our larger strategic goal is that we’re trying to provide one great platform for anyone dealing with digital content, to see how they’re monetizing,” Sanchez says.
