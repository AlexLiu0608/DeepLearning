SAN FRANCISCO — As the sun rises on FutureStack, New Relic’s first developer conference, we bring you some exciting news: The app-analytics company is rolling out support for Node.js.
Oh, yeah. It’s ticker-tape parade time.
“We’ll be market leaders in Node within 60 days, I’m sure of it,” said New Relic CEO Lew Cirne in an interview with VentureBeat this week.
High level but hands-on
Our upcoming DevBeat conference , Nov. 12-13 in San Francisco, will have a lot more on this topic. Featuring hacker legends like Stallman, DHH, Rasmus Lerdorf, and Alex Payne, it’s a hands-on developer event packed with:
workshops
live Ask-Me-Anything
hardware hacking
It’s all aimed at boosting your code skills, security knowledge, hardware hacking, and career development. Register now.
Node support will be available through New Relic directly and through an initial partner lineup that includes Joyent, Engine Yard, and CloudBees.
Understanding the new offering is pretty simple if you’ve already got a handle on New Relic’s core service: application performance monitoring, or APM. With Node.js plus New Relic, you can get real-time stats and charts for your Node-based apps, all the better to view crashes, catch memory hogs, and squash bugs.
And if you’re already using New Relic for your web and mobile apps, well bully for you, because you can see those plus your Node stuff from the same dashboard.
