Big data startup Cirro thinks you shouldn’t need technical savvy to make sense of your company’s data.
Cirro just closed an $8 million funding round led by Toba Capital, with participation from existing investors Frost Venture Partners and Miramar Venture Partners. The company will use the newly raised capital to build out its data analytics platform and scale up its sales, marketing, and support efforts.

Customers can deploy Cirro’s platform in the cloud or in their own data centers to track all the bits and bytes across their disparate databases (like Hadoop and NoSQL). The platform doesn’t require a semantic layer or  extract, transform, and load  process, which could prove attractive to enterprises without major IT resources.
“There have been previous attempts to solve the challenge of ‘analyzing data in disconnected data silos’ but they haven’t fared particularly well,” Don Howren, Cirro’s vice president of sales and marketing, told VentureBeat. “Cirro is a revolutionary approach to data federation that solves data access across disparate systems without the need to move, stage, or preprocess the data which for most is both time and cost prohibitive.”
Founded in 2010, Cirro is based in San Juan Capistrano, Calif., and currently has 12 employees. The company has “a few paying [customers] now” but couldn’t divulge any specifics.
