I have brain cancer. What’s your excuse?
By Ronnie Castro. If you think your entrepreneurial journey is tough, just read this guy’s story and put your own life in perspective.

30 years of being the only woman in the room — and how that’s changing
By Ellen Leanse: “As an investor, barely a day passes that I don’t hear a pitch from a bright, ambitious, woman founder addressing anything from dementia care to easy connectivity for the Internet of things. Again and again, they say they’d rather work with a female VC, rather have women advisers and board-members. I’m frequently told that they would prefer to collaborate with other women in a single-gender setting. For the first time in a long tech career, I’m starting to think they have a point.” Read more…

R.I.P. Boxee: 3 lessons to learn from Boxee’s demise
By Nathan Betzen, XBMC community manager: “For a long time, many of us at XBMC were big fans of Boxee. The company led the good fight against content providers on behalf of consumers.

Why I can’t work at Google
By David Hardtke, Bright.com chief scientist: “Every year or so a clever Google recruiter contacts me. I’d really like to work at Google at some point.

What makes a great VC
By Micah Baldwin: “Every year as the newly minted VCs begin to settle in and blog/tweet, there is a bevy of posts about how venture capital as it stands today is broken, and they, with their new insights and operational histories, are going to fix it. Of course, most of them become what they rail against over the course of the next few years. As I have started to think more and more about jumping the fence full-force into the investing side of the entrepreneurial equation I keep asking myself two questions…” Read more…

Why hiring B players will kill your startup
By Jon Soberg: “B players and C players are far worse than D’s and F’s. In fact, in my experience, B players are the worst hires you can make. Before getting into the details, it may be useful to level-set and explain what I mean by these employee stereotypes (although there have been some differences of opinion over the years.)” Read more…

Why hiring unicorns will kill your startup faster than ‘B players’
By Nicholas Holland: “Regardless of their level of experience or expertise, most entrepreneurs can agree that unicorns are majestic, magical creatures that absolutely do not exist — never have and never will.
