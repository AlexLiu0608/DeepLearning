Strategic Polymer Sciences , a company the produces sensory-feedback technology, has closed a new $8 million round of funding today.
The company also announced that it’s changing its name to Novasentis to better reflect its vision, which it describes as helping to usher in a “neosensory age in which previously lifeless devices come alive … .” The startup specializes in producing the ultra-thin, polymer-based sensory technology used in machines that aid in human interaction. It wants to allow those machines to sense vibrations, sounds, and movements the same way humans do.
Novasentis said the new funding will be used to increase production of some of its products and hire additional employees. The new round was led by Samsung Ventures and Chengwei Capital.
Founded in 2006, the Burlingame, Calif.-based startup has raised a total of $11 million in funding to date.
