Last week, Microsoft made a mistake, and today it’s making up for it. Sort of.
Since the release of Windows 8.1 on Thursday, users of Windows RT devices have reported the inability to boot their machines after upgrading. While Microsoft said that the issue affected “a limited number of users” the problems were so widespread that the company removed the Windows RT 8.1 upgrade from its website while it worked on a fix.
Now, to help those affected by the errors, Microsoft has released a recovery image for the Surface RT , which will enable users to restore their devices to their original factory condition. (Though it is a bit strange that it’s taken Microsoft quite this long to make that recovery image public.)
The thing to keep in mind, though, is that the recovery image only works for the Surface RT, so owners of other devices will have to hang tight until their respective manufacturers also offer similar fixes.
As for the actual Windows RT 8.1 updater — well, that’s still offline, and Microsoft has yet to give official comment on when it will return.
