A med-tech startup called  Kyron has closed $3 million in funding, according to an SEC filing .
Kyron’s data scientists are analyzing data from electronic medical records to generate new insights, such as the latent associations between medical conditions. The Silicon Valley-based company  boasts an impressive team of founders .
Cofounder Louis Monier was formerly CTO of search engine AltaVista and is an ex-Googler. Cofounder Noah Zimmerman has a doctorate in biomedical informatics from Stanford. Nigam Shah, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford, recently joined the team.
Kyron hasn’t launched yet, but I’m extremely curious about the product.
It’s certainly a hot space. The government passed legislation in 2009, dubbed the HITECH Act, to stimulate the adoption of electronic medical records (EMR). The goal of the HITECH Act is to reduce inflated health care costs by moving physicians from paper-based systems to modern alternatives.
Over 500 EMR systems subsequently flooded the market. A company like Kyron would likely integrate with some of the largest players in the space and help providers, payers, and patients make sense of the clinical data contained in an EMR.
Kyron raised its funding from Khosla Ventures, a Silicon Valley firm that is ramping up its investment in health care and education.
