Ray-Ban and VICE teamed up in 2013 to help make a select group of individuals’ visions come to life. The Envision Series inspires and facilitates creative ideas. The Ray-Ban/VICE team traveled the country searching for ideas it thought were worthy enough to back. While on the hunt for these ideas, the team also documented everyone from CODA leader Caroline O’Donnell to musician Dan Deacon and a number of other individuals who had a unique creative vision.
One of them is the multitalented Action Bronson. It all started in the family restaurant that Bronson developed his enduring fascination with quality eating.
After studying in the Art Institute of New York’s culinary program, he took jobs ranging from busboy to sous chef. Consequently, songs in his discography often read like menu items: “Roasted Bone Marrow,” “Pouches of Tuna,” “Jerk Chicken,” “Ceviche.”
While Bronson was a ravenous musical connoisseur who grew up admiring artists like Kool G. Rap, Cam’ron, and Mobb Deep, he never contemplated rapping himself. But with an oversized personality, intricate wordplay, and the cagey charm of an outer-borough striver, he was a natural.
And after a broken leg forced him out of the kitchen, Bronson began writing seriously. A couple critically acclaimed and widely loved mixtapes later, a few tours, Coachella, and a deal with VICE Records, Action has become a dominant force in the rap game. Ray-Ban and VICE have teamed up to take Action’s two loves and make them one.
Action’s vision of being able to cook and perform all in the same space is becoming a reality at this year’s Bushwick Block Party.
Action will have his own food truck serving an original menu created by the chef himself, and will be headlining the block party as well.
