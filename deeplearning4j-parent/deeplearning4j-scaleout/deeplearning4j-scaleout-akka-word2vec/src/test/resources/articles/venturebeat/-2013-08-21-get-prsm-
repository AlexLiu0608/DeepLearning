It seems every app is building some new awesome way to share, but none of them come close to PRSM , the latest app to help you share your emails, photos, videos, phone calls, text messages, Google searches, and trips to the toilet.
PRSM boasts unlimited storage, so you never have to worry about running out of space for all your content, and it already has 320 million users and partnerships with some of the biggest technology companies in Silicon Valley. It’s cross-platform, too, so no matter whether you’re Mac or PC, Android or iOS, you’re covered.
Sounds like it could be legitimate, but no. This is a parody of the National Security Agency’s PRISM program, a data-collection initiative the intelligence agency uses to get information about foreign targets who may be involved in terrorism.
Datacoup turned PRISM into a Silicon Valley “app” that seriously looks like it could have come straight out of Y Combinator. The vowel is even missing, people. There’s even a Twitter handle for the app @getprsm.
The company said on its website, “In light of recent events regarding the NSA’s sweeping data collection program, we put together a parody site that hopefully draws a laugh and some further attention to the issue.”
