Sony is set to debut a brand new streaming media device tomorrow that should have most of the same features available on Google’s new Chromecast streaming stick .
The device is one of many that hardware manufacturers are making after the apparent success of Google’s ultra low-cost streaming stick. The new Sony device, which is officially called the BRAVIA Smart Stick, is also probably a response to a growing number of consumers who prefer the easy navigation of watching content on their mobile devices, and subsequently pushing it to the TV screen once finding a video they want to watch.
The news announcement comes from a Sony blog post that has since been removed. However, Engadget points out that Sony’s announcement about is expected to happen this Sunday. Also, plenty of details about the device have been spread online thanks to FCC filings released earlier this year.
Some of what we do know about Sony’s BRAVIA Smart Stick, is that it will run on Android, which means it should have the capabilities to download Google TV apps as well as mirror your mobile device’s screen on to your TV set like Chromecast and Apple TV’s Airplay feature. Engadget notes that there is mention of a “picture-in-picture” feature that allows you to simultaniously watch TV while looking at a mirrored screen of your desktop.
The real test will be how much Sony will charge for its BRAVIA Smart Stick. If it’s comparable in price to Chromecast ($35), and offers the same kind of screen mirroring functionality for mobile devices, it will definitely be something to watch going forward.
