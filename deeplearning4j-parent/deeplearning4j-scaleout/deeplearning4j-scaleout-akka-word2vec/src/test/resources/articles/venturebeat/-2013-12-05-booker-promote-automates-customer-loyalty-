Booker Helps Businesses Generate More Revenue With New Automated       Email Marketing Tool That Keeps Existing Customers Coming Back
NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–December 5, 2013–
Booker ,       a leading cloud-based software provider that streamlines operations and       helps businesses grow their revenues, today launched Promote .       This new automated marketing system helps drive customer loyalty and       increase revenues for small-to-medium sized businesses. With Promote,       businesses automatically book more appointments from existing clients by       offering them smart discounts based on each customer’s last visit.
Business owners are challenged to meet the day-to-day demands of running       a successful business. Beyond managing daily operations, they try to       juggle bringing in new customers while keeping the existing customers       coming back consistently. Most owners simply don’t have the time to       directly contact their customers. Booker takes the complexity out of       customer loyalty by providing an easy-to-use solution that encourages       existing customers to return frequently.
“When it comes to customer relationship management, we are the only       company that enables local business to natively track the customer from       initial booking, to payment, and to repeat purchase in one easy app,”       said Josh McCarter, CEO of Booker. “Booker remembers your customers for       you, and Promote knows how to bring them back.”
McCarter Added, “We conducted early market testing with a select group       of businesses, all of whom saw significant increases in customer       retention and in new bookings. In the first three months, we found that       Promote generated an average of a 10x return on investment-it is       exciting to see how a single tool can make a business much more       successful.”
“Ever since we started the program, our numbers have gone up       consistently month-over-month,” said Adam Swanlund, CEO of Bii Salon.       “The Promote dashboard makes it very easy to see the effectiveness of       the tool. It’s great to see clients return simply because Promote sent       them a personalized offer.”
Promote taps into the email list already stored in a Booker client’s       account and then sends an attractive offer to customers that haven’t       booked their next appointment yet. Merchants can customize both the       depth of discount and frequency of communication based on their       individual business needs.
Pricing starts at $25 per month. Booker is so confident that Promote       will work that if after 12 months, Promote does not exceed the value a       merchant spent, Booker will refund the difference*.
