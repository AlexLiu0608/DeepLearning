NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 30, 2013–
Jibe ,       Inc., a leading provider of recruiting technology solutions, today       announced it has closed a $4 million credit facility from Silicon Valley       Bank. The funds lend further viability to Jibe’s position as one of the       fastest-growing technology innovators in the recruiting and human       capital management (HCM) market and will be used to continue the       company’s rapid expansion and growth.
“We are pleased to announce the close of this line of credit from       Silicon Valley Bank, one of the most respected sources in the technology       investment community,” stated Joe Essenfeld, Jibe founder & CEO. “This       comes at a time we are seeing significantly increased revenues and an       expansion of our client base, and provides us an opportunity to       accelerate our strategic growth plan. With the introduction this year of       new, data-driven and mobile solutions into a market ripe for disruption,       we feel we are extremely well-positioned to continue adding innovative       value to the global recruiting and HCM landscape.”
Technology research firm Gartner sizes the HCM market at $8.3 billion in       2014, and $8.8 billion in 2015. Already this year, Jibe has expanded its       significant footprint within the recruiting space by more than doubling       both its customer base and global headcount. The Company also built out       its solution set, expanding on its best-in-class mobile and social       recruiting tools with the launch of Recruiting Analytics™, recently       awarded with the “Awesome New Technology for HR” distinction at the 16th Annual HR Technology Conference & Expo.
“Our mission is to help our high-growth and innovative clients grow,”       said Michael McMahon, of Silicon Valley Bank in New York. “As Jibe       continues to expand at a rapid pace, it needs the support of an       experienced partner and flexible financing, and we’re pleased to play       that role.”
