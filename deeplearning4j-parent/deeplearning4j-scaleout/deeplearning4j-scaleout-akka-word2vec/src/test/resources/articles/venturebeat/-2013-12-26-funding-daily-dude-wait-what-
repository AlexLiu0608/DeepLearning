Maybe it was the cough syrup. Maybe it was the sugar crash. Coulda been the late-night new-video-game binge.*
Whatever it was, we’re definitely draggin’ today. It’s a post-holiday tradition, and we’re sure you feel the same pain.
But we’re still with it enough to record the funding deals of the day, from the big tens-of-millions round to the wee million-dollar debt deal.
Let’s get this over with:
QuizUp developer raises $22M
Plain Vanilla Games has just ended a Series B funding round that will add $22 million to its coffers. The developer, which is responsible for the QuizUp mobile trivia game, saw new investments from Tencent Holdings and Sequoia Capital. The latter company led the round. Plain Vanilla has raised more than $27 million to date. Go ahead, read the whole enchilada .
Groupay aims for $7M
London-based Groupay has taken in around $3.5 million of a proposed $7 million round of funding. The startup, which “automates the collection of money for SMEs [small to medium-size enterprises], improving cash-flows and allowing them to focus their time and attention on their core business,” previously took around $5 million in private equity mid-2013.
Roam sneaks in $1.7M
Software maker Roam Analytics is raising $1.75 million, according to an SEC filing today. The San Francisco-based startup is still stealthy, but here’s what we know: The team consists of three cofounders — Alex Turkeltaub, a Stanford/Yale grad; Joe Barefoot, formerly of Meltwater; and Stanford Ph.D candidate Andrew Maas. The latter’s experience lies in machine learning and speech recognition. We’ll see what the intrepid trio turns out in 2014.
Former Twitter engineers raise $1M
Pushd, a secretive startup led by former Twitter chief scientist Abdur Chowdhury, has raised $1.04 million in new funding, according to a a document the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission released today. The new funding, which Pushd disclosed to the SEC on Monday, comes almost a year-and-a-half after Pushd raised $1.35 million. Find out the rest of the scoop .
Software Revolution Corp takes $1M
A mysterious Form D filed today with the SEC shows that Tachyus cofounders Dakin Sloss and Paul Orland have taken a $1 million round of debt funding for “Software Revolution Corp.” — ordinarily, we would guess that’s the company’s legal name. And given Tachyus’ description — “predictive analytics software and sensors that measure real-time data to increase profits, promote safety, and enable regulatory compliance” for the oil and gas industry — the shoe appears to fit. The startup, still in semistealth mode, was founded in 2013.
