No, we’re not talking about weed, y’all.
Greentech is at the head and tail of today’s funding news, with an energy efficiency company working to complete a huge $17 million round and a clean energy startup taking a follow-on debt round to keep up momentum.
In the middle, we’ve got dogs, data, and cloud security.
Let’s start the show:
Optimum grows $17M round with Edison
Optimum Energy has grown its current fundraising activity with a new investment from Edison Energy. The amount was not disclosed, but SEC filings indicate the startup is working on a total $17 million raise. Optimum focuses on energy efficiency in the enterprise, i.e., data centers and server software.
HyTrust gets $18.5M
Cloud security automation startup HyTrust has announced its third round of institutional funding in the amount of $18.5 million. HyTrust wants to help any IT manager who not only has to look after many virtual machines, but also has to deal with looming compliance audits. The startup calls itself a “virtual appliance” that is installed right on the hypervisor, or the piece of technology that makes it possible to virtually separate different computers on one server. From there HyTrust monitors all of the traffic on your systems and can even tell if your physical hardware has been tampered with through a partnership with Intel.

GridGlo secures $1.1M
Startup GridGlo came out with a double-whammy today. It’s announcing a $1.1 million fundraise, and it’s giving itself a new name and brand. From now on, it’ll be known as TROVE Predictive Data Science. The product melds any kind of data a company or entity already has with data from an outside source — social data, census data, you name it. To date, its customers are mostly utilities.
Simpa follows with $250K
