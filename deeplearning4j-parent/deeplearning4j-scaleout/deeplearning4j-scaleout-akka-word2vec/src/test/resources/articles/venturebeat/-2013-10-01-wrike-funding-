Wrike , a startup that produces project management software, has secured a new $10 million round of funding to help grow the business, the company announced today.
Wrike’s main product is Graphite, a collaboration app that just rolled out a new design. Graphite, which is essentially a more social project management tool, helps people keep up with others who are working on a project within a group by offering tools like status updates, scheduling, an activity stream of everyone’s tasks, infographic tools, and notifications.
The new round of funding, Wrike’s first, was led by Bain Capital. As part of the funding deal, Bain’s managing director Todd MacLean and SurveyMonkey’s SVP Tim Maly will join the company’s board of directors.
Founded in 2006, the San Francisco, Calif.-based company has over 4,000 customers, such as Adobe, EMC, and Ecco. Wrike competes with other project management tools such as Asana and Clarizen .
