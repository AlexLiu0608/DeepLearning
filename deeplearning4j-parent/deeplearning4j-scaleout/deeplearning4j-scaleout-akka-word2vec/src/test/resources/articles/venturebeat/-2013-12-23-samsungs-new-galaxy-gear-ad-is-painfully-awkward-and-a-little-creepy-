In Samsung’s latest advertisement, Jack gets the girl by being a creep.
All he needs is a Galaxy Gear .
The two-and-a-half minute ad follows two men competing for a bombshell blonde. As the crew hits the slopes, Jack touts a Galaxy Gear smartwatch and Galaxy Note 3, while the other suitor only has a regular smartphone. With the Galaxy Gear, Jack can perform all sorts of 007-style tricks, from clandestinely snapping photos of the girl to demanding she speak her phone number into his watch.
“Want to see something cool?” he asks. “Here, give me your number. Just say it.” Even the actress looks hesitant.
