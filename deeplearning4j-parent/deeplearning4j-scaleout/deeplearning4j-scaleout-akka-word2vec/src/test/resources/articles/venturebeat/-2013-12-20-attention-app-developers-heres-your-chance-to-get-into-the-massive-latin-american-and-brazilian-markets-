The Movile Marketplace puts app developers from around the world directly in front of device manufacturers and carriers, who can choose to preload the apps to their phones in Latin America and Brazil.
The Movile Marketplace solves common problems developers experience when trying to expand into Latin America and Brazil, and it gives them a valuable opportunity to be preloaded on phones. Developers realize that Brazil and Latin America are expanding opportunities, but they need billing relationships with carriers, distribution networks, and marketing budgets to succeed in the new markets. The Marketplace leverages Movile’s relationships with carriers and OEMs to solve those problems. The Marketplace also connects excellent developers of any size directly with OEMs and carriers that they couldn’t have approached otherwise for a preloading agreement.
This is something Movile has already proven there’s an appetite for and shown that it can do extremely well. Already this year, Movile brought Apple, Huawei, LG, and Samsung (among others) together with apps that resulted in more than 10 million app placements.
Providing developers the chance to be preloaded onto millions of smartphones is an invaluable opportunity, especially in a region that is expected to be fourth in the world in smartphone adoption by 2017.
