Intel has reached an agreement to acquire natural language processing (NLP) startup  Indisys .
Indisys is based in Sevilla, Spain. The acquisition would give the chip maker voice-control technology, so it wouldn’t need to license code from third-party providers.
The deal closed May 31, but Intel did not make a public announcement, so details are only beginning to leak this week.
A number of Indisys employees will join Intel.  TechCrunch reports  that the startup was acquired for over $26 million, citing anonymous sources.
Intel’s appetite for acquisitions has picked up this year, as the company moves into perceptual computing and wearable technology. We reported in March that the company was in talks to buy gesture control firm Omek Interactive, and that acquisition was confirmed in the summer.
