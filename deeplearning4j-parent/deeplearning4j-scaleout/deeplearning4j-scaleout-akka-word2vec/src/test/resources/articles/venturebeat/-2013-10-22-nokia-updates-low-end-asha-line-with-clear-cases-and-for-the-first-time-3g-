While Nokia went big today with its latest Lumia announcements, it’s still paying attention to small and cheap phones with updates to its Asha lineup.
Today Nokia announced the Asha 500, 502, and 503, its latest round of inexpensive phone for emerging markets. All of the new Asha devices sport colorful designs under clear cases (which should make them more rugged), and the 503 also marks the first time 3G capabilities have reached the Asha line.
The new Asha phones will join the Asha 501 , which Nokia unveiled back in May. The 500 sports a 2.8-inch screen and 2 megapixel camera and will retail for just $69. The Asha 502 has a slightly larger 3-inch screen with a 5 megapixel camera and will go for $89. Finally, the Asha 503 includes a 3-inch screen, 5 megapixel camera, and the aforementioned 3G support.
All of the phones offer dual-SIM options, allowing you to easily use different cellular networks for different purposes. For example, you could use one SIM for work and one for personal use, or you can keep the second slot on stand-by to easily pop in a SIM card when you go abroad.
Like all the previous Asha phones, the new models run Nokia’s Asha platform, not Windows Phone. Even though Windows Phone has found success in some international markets, its low-end requirements are still too hefty for the market Nokia is aiming for with Asha.
The new phones come with interface upgrades to make it easier to share photos and access the phone’s cameras. The Asha 501 will also come with the popular messaging app WhatsApp, which Nokia says will hit the other Asha phones later this year.
