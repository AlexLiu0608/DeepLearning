Coffee brewing is getting more complicated and more nuanced and people absolutely love it. So, it’s no wonder that Cupertino-based Acaia has created a digital scale that brings the “art” down to a science.
The Bay Area takes its coffee seriously. Perhaps the interest has trickled down from our Seattle and Portland neighbors to the North, but Dunkin’ Donuts and Pete’s are no longer the special treat our techies reach brag about. They want properly “bloomed” brews that have been slowly dripped from funnel-like drippers that this tea-drinker doesn’t quite get.
But if that’s what you’re into, this scale seems pretty cool. The Acaia scale, which is raising money on Kickstarter , looks almost exactly like an Apple TV device, and comes with  an app.
First and foremost, the scale acts as a very pretty scale. It uses touch-sensing buttons only, so you don’t have to worry about ground beans getting stuck in between keys. You can put your dripper, french press, or other coffee-brewing mechanism, on the scale and use the app to time its progress. On the app you can choose which method you are using and time for the right “bloom.”
The company says it has also used a special micro-controller unit chip that is primarily used in industrial scales. It hopes this chip will make it easier to distribute software updates as it introduces new features. In the future, the company plans to offer a social component where you can swap notes with friends about coffee beans and brewing processes.
The company has made $16,613 of its $30,000 crowdfunding goal.
We’re not surprised that this coffee scale is taking a techie route. Blue Bottle, an upscale coffee chain in San Francisco and New York, got $20 million from True Ventures . Yes, even tech VCs are loving specialty caffeine.
We imagine if Acaia is going to take off, the Bay Area is the place to do it.
