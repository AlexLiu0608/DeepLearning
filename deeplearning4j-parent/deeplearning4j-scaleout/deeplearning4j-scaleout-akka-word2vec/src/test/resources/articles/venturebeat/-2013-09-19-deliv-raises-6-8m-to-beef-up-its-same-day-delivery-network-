To get a same-day delivery right, you need three things: partnerships, scale, above all, money.
Same-day delivery network Deliv has all of those, especially the last. The Palo Alto-based company announced today that it’s raised $6.85 million in a Series A round led by Upfront Ventures and RPM Ventures, which have previously invested in retail giants like Costco and Starbucks. (Deliv has raised a total of $7.85 million to date.)
Deliv, which is sort of like a retail-focused Fed Ex, plugs into retailers’ websites, giving online customers the option of getting purchases delivered on the same day from local stores. That’s a big deal for brick-and-mortar retailers, who are still looking for ways to be more than just showrooms for Amazon.
The funding comes just a month after  Deliv announced its partnership with shopping mall operator General Growth Partners (GGP) , which operates 123 malls in the United States.
Deliv CEO Daphne Carmeli says the funding will be used to scale operations, which means adding more partners and bolstering its crowdsouced driver network.
“We’re focused on large omni-channel national chains. The winners of this space are going to be those companies that can get as many retailers on board as possible,” Carmeli said.
While the GGP deal is Deliv’s biggest so far, Carmeli says the company is in talks with other large mall retailers as well.
