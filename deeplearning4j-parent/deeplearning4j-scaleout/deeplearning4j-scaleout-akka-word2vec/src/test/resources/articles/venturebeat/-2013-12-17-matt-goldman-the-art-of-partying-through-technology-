Ray-Ban and VICE teamed up in 2013 to help make a select group of individuals’ visions come to life. The Envision Series was a way to inspire and facilitate creative ideas. The team traveled the country searching for ideas it thought were worthy enough to back. While on the hunt for these ideas, the team also documented everyone from Dan Deacon to CODA and a number of other individuals who had a unique creative vision.
One of them was event producer Matt Goldman. Matt is rare in the fact that he can make any production he works on both aesthetically memorable and functional. From his stint at UCLA design school to becoming a senior art director for Shepard Fairey’s Studio Number One to starting his own company MFG Productions, there seems to be no slowing down for Matt. Whether it’s design, production, promotion, or anything between, when Matt has a vision he makes it a reality for everyone to enjoy.
During the second weekend of Coachella, VICE and Ray-Ban hosted The Envision Series official launch party in Palm Springs, Calif. Matt not only produced the entire event but also created a 360 degree video and sound installation that served as a trippy yet relaxing getaway for partygoers. Guests lost themselves as Matt’s images and scenes gently bombarded their senses.
