SAN FRANCISCO â€” Intel research executive Genevieve Bell showed that a smartphone can recognize who is holding it by the way the person walks.
The device uses its accelerometer and gyroscope to recognize the pattern of the way you walk, whether you are in high heels or sneakers. It recognizes your gait from measuring that data for a long time. It knows how you move and at what pace, and makes a determination of who you are.
Onstage today at the Intel Developer Forum, Lama Nachman, an Intel researcher walked with a smartphone, and measurements from the accelerometer and gyro showed up in real time on the big screen. Then Bell took the phone and walked with it. Within a matter of a dozen steps, it recognized that she as an imposter and locked the phone.
The demo was created by Intel Labs and it is not a product yet.
