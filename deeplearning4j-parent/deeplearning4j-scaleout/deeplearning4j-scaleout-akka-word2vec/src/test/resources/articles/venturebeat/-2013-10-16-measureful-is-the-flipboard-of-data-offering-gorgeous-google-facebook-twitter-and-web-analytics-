If you’ve ever managed a site, launched a Facebook page, run a Twitter campaign, or tried to sell anything via Google AdWords, you know one of the key challenges of analytics:
So much data, so little knowledge.
That’s exactly the problem that a tiny three-person Portland startup, Measureful , is trying to solve. The company is launching its product today, and based on what I’ve seen so far, it’s got a shot at totally reinventing analytics for those of us who need to use data … not just collect it.
“People are trying to get from all these reports and information to: Here’s what happened, here’s why, and here’s what to do about it,” founder and data geek John Koenig told me this morning. “We present what I think is a totally unique report layout that no-one’s ever seen … drawing inspiration from Flipboard.”
Here’s a sample report drawn from Google Analytics. Scroll through and tell me you’ve seen something like this before — automated:
Koenig, a former data analyst, ran a digital agency focusing on search engine marketing for five years, so he knows firsthand what the problems facing web marketers are. And he has personal experience with taking data from sources like Google, Facebook, and Twitter and trying to turn it into actionable insight and presentable solutions.
“It’s not just about distilling the findings but presenting them,” he says. “With our smart reporting, you flip a switch, distill your data, see anomalies and trends, and conduct statistical analysis, all automatically.”
Currently, Measureful works with Google Analytics and Facebook stats. The company is already sucking data from the Twitter firehose and will be adding Twitter analytics in the next four weeks, and Google AdWords, SEO keyword rankings from Authority Labs, plus a custom data upload-and-crunch tool, are all coming in the same time-frame.
