King has taken its hugely popular Candy Crush Saga to the Kakao Talk mobile messaging platform in South Korea.
The move is significant because Kakao Talk, a mobile messaging platform that has replaced text messaging in Korea, has grown dramatically in the past year, with many Kakao games taking slots in the top 10 games worldwide on Google Play. In just a year, Kakao has accumulated 30 million players and more than 400 million game downloads.
London-based King has more than 15.5 million people playing Candy Cursh Saga on Facebook, and it’s played more than 700 million times daily on Android and iOS devices. Candy Crush Saga is a match-3 puzzle game with 400 levels and a big multiplayer following.
“In Candy Crush Saga for Kakao, King has developed exclusive features that specifically fit to the mobile messenger based SNS Kakao Talk and bring a unique and fun social gaming experience to its millions of subscribers across Korea,” said Tommy Palm, games guru at King, in a statement. “For the first time Kakao users will be able to fully immerse themselves in all aspects of the social world of Candy Crush Saga, from sending requests to friends via ‘Kakao Talk’s’ chat, to sharing quirky emoticons which have been exclusively developed for Kakao.”
