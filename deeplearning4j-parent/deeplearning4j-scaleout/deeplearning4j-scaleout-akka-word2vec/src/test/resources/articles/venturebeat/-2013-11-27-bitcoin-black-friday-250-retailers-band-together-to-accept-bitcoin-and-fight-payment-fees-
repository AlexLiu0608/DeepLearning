More than 250 retailers are banding together in Bitcoin Black Friday so that you can buy your Christmas tree, holiday flights, authentic Moroccan rugs, and booze, or pay for your next hot date, all with privacy and safety … in Bitcoin.
The goal is more widespread adoption of Bitcoin which, the currency’s founders believe, will make the virtual currency harder to legislate and regulate.
“Bitcoin Black Friday is an awesome way to bring the whole Internet community together at a time when Bitcoin needs as much mainstream attention as possible,” said Holmes Wilson, cofounder of Fight for the Future , which is organizing the event. “Even though it seems like Bitcoin is going strong, it won’t be politically safe until it’s widely used by average Internet users — that’s already happening, but we’re speeding things up with Bitcoin Black Friday, and making it fun in the process.”
Bitcoin brings plenty of benefits to online retailers, Fight for the Future says.
Those include almost no payment fees on transactions. Buyers might not see the multiple fees on transactions currently levied on most online purchases, but vendors certainly do. PayPal, credit cards, and debit cards all have more or less hidden fees. The use of Bitcoin will help Internet merchants set prices just a little bit lower. And, of course, Bitcoin transactions are private and encrypted.
Participating companies include OK Cupid, CheapAir.com, the ever-popular software-focused Humble Bundle, GOOD Magazine, CityWineCellar, Shave like Dad, and Exohosting, which is offering 35 percent off web hosting when you pay with Bitcoin.
But it’s not just about getting. Fight for the Future is also interesting in promoting giving.
As part of Bitcoin Black Friday, the organization has lined up 16 charities who accept Bitcoin, including BitGive, a Philippines relief effort, AntiWar.com, Fight for the Future itself, and Hoodie the Homeless.
Oh, and if you want to get really meta, you can spend your Bitcoin on making more Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining companies such as Openrigs and The Bitcoin Mining Outlet are also offering deals on computer equipment to decrypt more cash.
