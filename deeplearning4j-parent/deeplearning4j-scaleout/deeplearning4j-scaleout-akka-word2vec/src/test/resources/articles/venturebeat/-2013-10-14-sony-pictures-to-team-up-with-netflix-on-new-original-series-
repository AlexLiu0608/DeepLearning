The next original series coming to Netflix will be produced by major studio Sony Pictures, the company announced today.
The move is significant because Sony is a major studio, and this could signal what kind of content Netflix subscribers can expect in the future. Netflix has previously seen great success with many of its other original shows, such as House of Cards, Hemlock Grove, and Orange Is The New Black.
The new original from Sony comes from the creators of FX series Damages Todd A. Kessler, Daniel Zelman, and Glenn Kessler. The show itself, which doesn’t have a name, “centers on a family of adult siblings whose secrets and scars are revealed when their black sheep brother returns home,” according to Netflix. It will run for 13 episodes in its first season and debut in early 2014.
“We’re willing to do different things and bet on the future,” Sony Pictures Television president Steve Mosko told the Wall Street Journal . “We’re pumped up—it’s a challenge to show a major studio can be in business with one of these services.”
Netflix is working on a slew of other original shows that should be available sometime in the next year, including children’s show TURBO Fast with Dreamworks and sci-fi drama Sense8 from the Wachowskis siblings and J. Michael Straczynski.
