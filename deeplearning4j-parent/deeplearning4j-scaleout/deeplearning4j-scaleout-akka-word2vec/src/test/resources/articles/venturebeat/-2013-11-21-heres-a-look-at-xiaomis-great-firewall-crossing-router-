Xiaomi, Chinese smartphone maker and software provider, launched a smart router, MiWiFi , today. Pre-order is open today, and the first batch will be available for sale on its website on December 19th.
The company didn’t disclose any specifications, claiming it will be comparable to top offerings in its class. Also, Xiaomi claims it will be super fast. As for the features, the only one mentioned is that it can cross the Great Firewall, just like HiWiFi and a few others that emerged this year in China.
HiWiFi was one of the first smart routers in China that added an app platform layer. Of all the apps HiWiFi has developed, at least two are attractive to users. One is for blocking ads on online video services; another is the one Xiaomi touts, too.
HiWiFi has raised Series A funding . Smart Wi-Fi routers  have become a hot topic in China . Ambitious players bet that it will eventually revolutionize the multiple-screen future just like web browsers revolutionized the PC past.
Some Chinese Internet companies such as Qihoo and Sogou have successfully taken advantage of their web browser user base, having been making money from online advertising and revenue shares from paying services like online game.
