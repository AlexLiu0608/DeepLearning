Amazon has launched a new digital publication dedicated to fiction and short stories called Day One, the company announced today.
The move is only the latest action by Amazon to grow its presence as not only a seller of digital media, but also a place where creators can publish original works. Previously, the company released things like its Kindle comic creator tool , Kindle Singles for short serialized works, its Kindle singles interview series , and even its Kindle Worlds for fan-fiction.
The Day One journal will be a 52-week anthology of works that feature one author and one poet per week. Amazon is setting the price at $20 for a year’s subscription (it’s offering a promotion of half that price for the moment). This seems like a smart move considering this is content mostly from creators that aren’t in the public eye. If Amazon tried to charge a weekly, or even monthly, price to access the literary journal, it might not be able to pull in an audience long enough to create something that people come back to every week.
It’ll be interesting to see if Amazon is able to re-spark interest in literary journals and turn it into a lucrative business. For now, all we can really say is that the company is definitely playing a long game.
