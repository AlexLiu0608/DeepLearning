Aiden , an app hoping to simplify communication between patients who suffer from depression and their therapists, has won the grand final of this year’s StartupBus Europe Tour.
Currently, Kristina Wilms, from Germany, is at the Pioneers Festival in Vienna building up her app’s first prototype in preparation to pitch at the hackathon ending the two-day conference.
The idea, which won the AppHappening Innovation Contest and helped Wilms secure a spot on StartupBus Europe, was inspired by her own struggles with depression.
“One of the most important elements in the treatment of depression and burn-out is the recording of the persons’ behavior patterns,” she said.
“At the moment, patients are asked to fill out special forms which they have to carry around all day and are both indiscreet and impractical.”
Here’s a video demo:
One of Aiden’s core features will be to help patients report detailed accounts of mood and feelings into the mobile app in real-time so healthcare professionals can receive accurate data. As for the business model, Wilms hopes to license the app to therapists, who would then supply it to patients suffering from depression.
