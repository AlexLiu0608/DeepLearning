Online media production company Maker Studios has just secured another $26 million in funding, the company announced today.
Maker Studios gained popularity by producing content that was wildly popular on YouTube. It currently has more than 4 billion views online per month and 260 million subscribers on over 60,000 channels. (Some of its popular content producers include “Epic Rap Battles of History,”  the  Shaytards , Snoop Dogg’s WestFestTV,  The Gregory Brothers , and Bad Lip Reading .) However, the company recently  purchased video distribution startup Blip to help branch out away from YouTube. And with today’s new funding, it looks like the company is also turning its attention to building content that appeals to international audiences.
“Our objective was to expand our investor base to include major players in key international markets,” said Maker Studios executive chairman Ynon Kreiz in a statement. “With talent in more than 80 countries, our viewers outside the U.S. already account for more than half our total audience, and our new partners will be instrumental in continuing our growth as a truly global media company.”
The new investment is part of Maker’s third round of funding and included participation by Canal +, Astro, SingTel Innov8, Lakestar, Northgate Capital and existing investor Upfront Ventures. The first part of Maker’s round was a $40 million investment from Time Warner Investments , Greycroft Partners, and others back in November 2012. This brings the total amount in the round to $62 million in funding.
Founded in 2009, the Culver City, Calif.-based startup has raised a total of $64.5 million in funding to date.
