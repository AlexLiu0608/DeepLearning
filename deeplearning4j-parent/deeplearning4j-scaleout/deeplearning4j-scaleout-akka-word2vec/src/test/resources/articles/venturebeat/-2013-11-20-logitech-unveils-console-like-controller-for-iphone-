Logitech is joining the fray for making game controllers for mobile devices. The company announced today the Logitech PowerShell, which provides console-style game controls for an iPhone or iPod Touch device.
It works with iOS 7 devices including the iPhone 5s, iPhone 5, and the iPod Touch fifth generation. And it is one of the many devices that will take advantage of the fact that iOS 7 now works with MFI-certified controller-like devices.
To use it, you insert your iPhone into a slot in the middle of the controller. Then you can use the analog offscreen controls, including a D-pad positional pad on the left and buttons on the right. But the big difference is that the Logitech device does not have dual analog sticks on it.
On top of that, the device also charges your iPhone as you play.
With the PowerShell, you can use the entire screen for viewing a game, rather than clogging it up with your fingers as you try to use touchscreen controls. The controller should work particularly well with console games such as shooters. The device fits in your pocket and looks about as big as the older PlayStation Portable devices.
“We designed this controller to deliver a true console-gaming experience on an iOS 7 mobile device,” said Ehtisham Rabbani, the general manager of the Logitech gaming business. “With gaming so pervasive on the mobile platform – our research shows that 87 percent of iPhone and iPod touch users play games on their device – it’s time to revolutionize the experience.”
The device gives you full access to power on/off, volume, camera, speakers, headphone jack, and charging. The controller has a 1,500 milliamp battery to supplement the battery of your mobile phone. You can recharge both batteries without removing the phone from the controller.
The Logitech PowerShell Controller + Battery is available online beginning today for $99.99 at BestBuy.com and the Apple Online Store. Competitors include PowerA’s Moga division, which reportedly has an iPhone controller in the works.
