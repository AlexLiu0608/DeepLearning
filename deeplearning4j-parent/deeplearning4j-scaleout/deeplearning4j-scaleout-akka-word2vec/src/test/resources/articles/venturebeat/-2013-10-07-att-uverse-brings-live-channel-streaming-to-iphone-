AT&T has updated its Uverse television service application for iPhone with a new feature that allows you to watch live streaming TV channels directly from the device, the company announced today.
AT&T is only the latest in a long line of cable providers that are beginning to see the value in offering their customers the ability to watch television independent of their location. Time Warner Cable was among the first to offer this sort of functionality, but only began allowing live streaming channels via the Internet for some stations recently.
As for the new Uverse app, customers can stream 108 channels to their device at this time and about 25 when they aren’t on their home Internet connection. There’s also a new features that lets you use your iPhone as a remote control and toggle on parental controls.
The updated Uverse app is available for free today via Apple’s App Store . An updated version for Android is expected to roll out later this month.
