American Efficient wants to help everyone in the U.S. switch to renewable power suppliers and products through its energy-efficient-focused marketplaces.
The startup launched today with $2.5 million in funding from Clean Pacific Ventures.
American Efficient has two separate marketplaces: one that connects consumers with “renewable power plans” available through their local and trusted providers. Dubbed the Clean Choice Network, it focuses on that trust factor saying people have seen renewable power marketing, but likely thought it was too good to be true.
The company also supports a product-focused energy-saving marketplace called Dreamstreet. American Efficient hopes will be “a veritable Kayak.com for energy-consuming home products.” It works with a number of local and online retailers to pull all kinds of energy-saving devices into one place where people can review them, compare prices, check out photos of the devices, and availability. Dreamstreet launched with 2.2 million households already signed up.
It will also work with utilities to tell customers where or not they’re do for an upgrade to certain appliances such as your HVAC system.
The company is based in San Mateo, Calif and has been in beta, or a testing period, for 18 months.
