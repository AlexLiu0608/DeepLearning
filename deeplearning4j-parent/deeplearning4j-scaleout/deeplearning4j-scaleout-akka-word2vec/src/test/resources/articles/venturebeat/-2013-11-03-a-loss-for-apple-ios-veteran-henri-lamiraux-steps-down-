Henri Lamiraux, Apple’s top Vice President of Engineering for the iOS iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch, has left the company, according to a report from 9to5mac.com .
Lamiraux had worked at the Cupertino, Calif.-based technology giant for over 20 years, so his departure comes as a shock to the community.
According to 9to5mac, Lamiraux decided to retire two weeks ago and said that iOS7 would be his final release.
The French executive joined the company in the early days, back in 1990. He worked his way up the corporate ladder and helped build the original operating system for the first iPhone. His name is featured on a number of Apple patents, including visual voicemail .
Apple has not confirmed or commented on who will replace Lamiraux. We’ll keep you posted as we learn more.
