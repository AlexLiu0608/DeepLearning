Fortscale’s Enriched Big Data Analytics Help Security Teams to       Discover Advanced Cyber Threats caused by Rouge or Compromised Users and       by Their Suspicious Access to Resources
NEW YORK & TEL AVIV, Israel–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 24, 2013–
Fortscale ,       an Israeli-based Big Data cyber security analytics start-up, today       announced that it is one of the big data startups that has been chosen       to present its technology to thousands of attendees at the prestigious       O’Reilly Strata + Hadoop World 2013 conference to be held in New York on       October 28-30, 2013. The finalists were chosen from dozens of start-ups       by the O’Reilly “Startup Showcase” team, comprised of leading investors       and industry analysts.
Fortscale’s ground-breaking solution enables enterprises to easily run       big data analytics for cyber security, without the need for       technological expertise. Combining dynamic machine learning algorithms,       a user-friendly analyst’s toolbox and a scalable Hadoop environment,       Fortscale’s advanced analytics are layered on top of the existing       capabilities of Big Data platforms to provide timely intelligence that       can be used by security analysts to discover, investigate and remediate       security threats. Fortscale’s analytics are particularly effective in       identifying suspicious user behavior and risky activity that cannot be       discovered by rule-based security mechanisms.
“We are proud to have been chosen as a finalist for the Big Data Startup       Showcase,” said Idan Tendler, Fortscale CEO and co-founder. “Strata +       Hadoop World is a key event for the Big Data community, and provides us       with a great opportunity to demonstrate the innovative ways we use big       data analytics to solve the real-world cyber security challenges facing       today’s enterprises.”
Fortscale’s beta product, known as Fortscale 1.0, was publicly unveiled       last month at the annual worldwide Splunk user conference and has been       running at several large global companies with outstanding results. The       product is currently available for additional qualified private beta       partners, with product launch planned for the end of 2013.
To support its beta installations and growing business activities in the       US, which will be accelerated following the upcoming product release,       Fortscale has recently opened a new office in New York.
The Startup Showcase is also part of the NYC Data Week, held from       October 27 – November 2 in New York.
