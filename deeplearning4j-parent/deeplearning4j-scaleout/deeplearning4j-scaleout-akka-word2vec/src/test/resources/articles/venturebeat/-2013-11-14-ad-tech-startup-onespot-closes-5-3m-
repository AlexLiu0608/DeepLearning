OneSpot has raised $5.3 million to help grow its ad targeting platform, the company announced today.
OneSpot works much like a programmatic ad network but aims to transform real content into display ads that can run on all the leading ad networks (Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, etc.). It adds credibility to those ads by placing social badges within them, too. More recently the company opened up new ways for companies and brands with a content marketing strategy to increase their visibility through its Content Sequencing Engine technology.
The startup said it plans to use the new capital to increase its sales and marketing as well as continue developing its ad tech products.
The series A round of funding was led by Mohr Davidow Ventures with participation from Mack Capital, RSL Ventures, Capital Factory, and Bazaarvoice cofounder Brett Hurt. As part of the funding deal, Mohr Davidow Ventures general partner Bryan Stolle will join OneSpotâ€™s board.
Founded in 2012, the Austin, Texas-based startup has raised a total of $6.8 million in funding.
