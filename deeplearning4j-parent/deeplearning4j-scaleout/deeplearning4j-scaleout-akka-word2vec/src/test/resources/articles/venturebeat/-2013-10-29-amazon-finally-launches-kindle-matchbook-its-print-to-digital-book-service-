Amazon has opened up its Kindle MatchBook service today, offering customers a way to buy digital versions of books they’ve purchased on Amazon for a discounted price.
The offer, which was introduced back in early September, is good on any book purchased as far back as 1995, which for most people means any book they’ve ever bought on Amazon. The conversion price is a reasonable $3, $2, $1, or in some cases, even free. The only catch is that publishers have to sign up for the MatchBook service before Amazon can begin offering these sorts of deals.
I’ve previously said this was probably the smartest way for Amazon to pull in new customers to their digital media store because it plays upon people’s entire history of shopping on Amazon. I’m much more likely to give Amazon a chance when it come to the next volume in a book series I’m reading simply because I can spend a couple bucks to have the entire set now available digitally — and I probably won’t even mess with buying a print version for that next book.
The service also includes graphic novels, and I was absolutely surprised to see the first volume of Brian Michael Bendis’s All New X-Men (which is excellent , by the way) in the main image on MatchBook’s splash page. Marvel already has a deal with ComiXology that allows those who buy the hardcover version of this book (and many others) to receive a free digital copy. And now, anyone who buys the paperback version will also be eligible for a low-cost digital upgrade.
