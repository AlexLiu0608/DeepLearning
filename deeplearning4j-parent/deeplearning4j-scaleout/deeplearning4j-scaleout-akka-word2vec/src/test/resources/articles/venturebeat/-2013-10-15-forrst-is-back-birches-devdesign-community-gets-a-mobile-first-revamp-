Forrst , a cult classic among web and mobile developers and designers, is making a big comeback today with a ground-up overhaul that puts the focus on mobile.
Let’s go on a hyperspeed jaunt down memory lane: Forrst was the brainchild of one Kyle Bragger, an awesome hacker guy in San Francisco. It worked kind of like a Dribbble (a popular design community) for developers as well as designers, letting you post code snippets and design samples for critique and comments from your peers.
From day one, it was really cool, and people liked it.
Then, Bragger sold the whole shebang to Colourlovers , where it received no attention and slowly began to stagnate.
Zurb to the rescue! Dev shop Zurb bought Forrst, because, as a Zurber told us at the time, “We were intrigued by the existing community of designers/developers on the site, and the opportunity to evolve the interface into something great.”
High level but hands-on
Our upcoming DevBeat conference , Nov. 12-13 in San Francisco, will have a lot more on this topic. Featuring hacker legends like Stallman, DHH, Rasmus Lerdorf, and Alex Payne, it’s a hands-on developer event packed with:
workshops
live Ask-Me-Anything
hardware hacking
It’s all aimed at boosting your code skills, security knowledge, hardware hacking, and career development. Register now.
Interestingly, just weeks after the acquisition, Zurb rolled out Foundation 4 , its mobile-first front-end framework. Coincidence?
That brings us up to date, with the unveiling of Forrst’s new face and functionality. And yes, it’s all based on Foundation 4, which means added smartphone and tablet features.
Since the acquisition and the Foundation launch were so close together, Forrst ended up being a great testing ground for the platform.
“It was a very big case study,” said a Zurbonian to VentureBeat via email.
“It was one of the first sites we approached with a mobile first direction with Foundation 4. This will give designers and developers an example of how mobile first can improve the success of a site.”
Another interesting factor is that Zurb decided to take a mobile-first stance without planting a flag in any particular mobile OS or OSes. That’s right; we’re talkin’ mobile web.
“We very much believe in responsive design. We believe responsive is the future of the web,” a Zurbian told us.
“We also added annotation boxes from our Notable app technology. We needed to consider what was the best way for Forrsters to give feedback from a mobile device,” said a Zurbite in a statement on today’s news.
“Now users can quickly and conveniently add their feedback precisely in the spot where they are looking to add their thoughts about an image.”
In addition to a design upgrade, Zurb said it also wants to focus on building the community behind Forrst: all those talented web and mobile folks, creative and technical alike.
Here’s what the new Forrst looks like:
