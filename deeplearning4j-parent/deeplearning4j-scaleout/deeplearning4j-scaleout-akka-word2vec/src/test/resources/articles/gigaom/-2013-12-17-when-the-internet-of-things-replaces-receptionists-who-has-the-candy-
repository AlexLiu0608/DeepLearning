Summary:
The connected home has some kinks, but Kevin and I discuss how to solve some of them. We also chat with a CEO who has built a connected office to learn how he did it.
The smart home is still pretty dumb, but that doesn’t mean we should give up or write whiney diatribes in PC Magazine. This week, Kevin Tofel and I discuss this article about one writer’s frustrations with the NEst thermostat and why it’s not a great indictment o n the connected home. We also discuss what Wi-Fi connected sensor Kevin might use to track vibration. He thought my Twine and WigWag suggestions were a bit too pricey.
In general on the show we spend a lot of tim discussing how we can automate our homes , but this week’s guest J Schwan, CEO and Founder of Solstice Mobile discusses how he’s using Beacons, Wi-Fi connected cameras and other tools to build a connected office. He’s built some pretty cool functionality into a suite of software called SmartOffice, that can show who’s in a conference room and may one day help him eliminate his receptionist. We discuss that and the concept of privacy for employees in this week’s show.
