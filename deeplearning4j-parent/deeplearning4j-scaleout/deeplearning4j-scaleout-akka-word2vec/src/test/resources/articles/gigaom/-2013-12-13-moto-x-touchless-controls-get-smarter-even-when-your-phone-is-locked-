One of my fave and most used features on the Moto X smartphone got a little bit smarter: Motorola improved the Touchless Control app with a new update available in the Google Play Store. As noted by Android Central , the app now interacts with more Google Now commands even when the Moto X is locked. And, assuming nobody is around, you can unlock your Moto X by speaking your PIN code. Lastly, the app has a new listening sound when you say “OK Google Now”; just in case you weren’t sure the phone was always listening. (Hint: It is.)
