Summary:
Simple.tv is getting ready to launch its cord cutting DVR in a number of international markets, and bring its mobile app to Android.
Bay Area-based digital video startup Simple.tv is looking to launch its DVR for cord cutters in the U.K. in March of 2014, and target continental Europe soon after. Simple.tv CEO Mark Ely told me during an interview Wednesday that his company aims to launch in Germany after it introduces its product in the U.K., and then bring it to France, Spain and Italy. Later in 2014, Simple.tv wants to introduce its DVR in Australia, New Zealand and South America.
Simple.tv first launched a networked DVR capable of recording free broadcast HDTV and then streaming it to mobile devices and Roku boxes in the U.S. in late 2012. The company recently announced its second-generation hardware , which is being produced by SiliconDust , and will go on sale later this month. Ahead of that launch, Simple.tv is also going to release its very first Android app. Check out the video below for Ely giving me a quick demo of this app:
The new app experience will debut on Android first, and then find its way to iOS via an app update, and it will work with the new hardware as well as existing first-generation Simple.tv DVRs.
Ely told me that Simple.tv switched metadata providers specifically to prepare itself for markets outside of the U.S. Previous versions of Simple.tvâ€™s software were based on data from Rovi, but this new version is based on data from Gracenote, which offers companies access to TV listings from 28 countries.
