Do you know about Apple’s “12 Days of Digital Gifts” campaign? American users have been left out of Cupertino’s annual free gift app until now, as it has only been available within select countries. But 9to5Mac reports that this year, the U.S. has been brought in on the fun. iTunes users who download the app will be able to snag a select piece of digital media for free every 24 hours, starting on December 26. The app is available for download now for both iPhone and iPad in the iTunes App Store .
