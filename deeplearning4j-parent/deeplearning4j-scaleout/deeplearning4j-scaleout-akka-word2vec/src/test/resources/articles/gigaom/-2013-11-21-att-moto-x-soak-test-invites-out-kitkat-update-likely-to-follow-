Motorola surprised everyone on Tuesday when it announced that Moto X KitKat updates were rolling out – to Verizon users. But now it looks like AT&T shouldn’t be far behind, as the carrier has reportedly sent out soak test invites.
The invite, which made its way to Android Central , doesn’t mention Android 4.4 specifically. But “an early preview of a new software release” pretty much gives us all we need to infer that it’s a tasty serving of KitKat.
The Moto X KitKat soak test for Verizon went live just a day before the carrier pushed out the official update to all users. The AT&T update might not show up tomorrow, but it’s safe to say that you can expect it to arrive pretty soon.
