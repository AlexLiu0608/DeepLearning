Summary:
Katie Couric is leaving ABC News for Yahoo, where she will become David Pogue’s new boss, and do some features for Yahoo’s homepage.
Veteran news anchor Katie Couric has been hired by Yahoo to become “the face of Yahoo news,” as Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer said in a blog post Monday . Mayer added:
“As Global Anchor, Katie joins Megan Liberman,David Pogue, Matt Bai and our incredibly talented editorial team in pioneering a new chapter of digital journalism. At Yahoo, we are investing in bringing our users the absolute best content and video experiences available — and this is just the beginning!”
The announcement was light on details, but it looks like Couric will continue to host her daytime talk show Katie on ABC, but leave ABC News, where she occasionally appeared as a special correspondent. For Yahoo, she will be doing feature reporting that is going to “air” on Yahoo’s home page as well as head a team of Yahoo News correspondents including recent hire David Pogue. Her official title with the company is Global News Anchor.
Mayer’s announcement of the new hire didn’t really come as a surprise: Reports had anticipated the announcement a few days ago already, and AllThingsD first brought up the possibility of a partnership between Couric and Yahoo in August.
