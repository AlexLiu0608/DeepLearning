Law enforcement officials in San Diego arrested 27-year Kevin Bollaert on Tuesday, slapping him with more than 30 criminal charges related to “UGotPosted,” a website that displayed women’s photos along with personal information like their name, address and Facebook profile.
According to court documents, Bollaert made tens of thousands of dollars through a second website called “changeyourreputation,” which allowed people to remove photos in exchange for fees of around $300.
“I feel bad about the whole thing and like I just don’t want to do it anymore. I mean I know a lot of people are getting like on the site. Like their lives are getting ruined,” Bollaert told an officer in the course of the investigation.
Investigators obtained information by obtaining search warrants for Bollaert’s Gmail and Cloudflare accounts, and by talking to 12 “Jane Does” who told stories of being stalked, harassed and embarrassed.
California’s Attorney General described the arrest as a victory against “revenge porn” websites, which permits people to post compromising photos of other people without their consent. (A similar business of embarrassment and extortion has emerged around mugshot websites, according to the New York Times ).
California is one of two states to pass controversial laws outlawing revenge porn, which some fear will be ineffective and also stifle free speech. In the case of Bollaert, however, the charges do not cite the revenge porn statute (647(j)(4) of the California Criminal Code), but instead the 31 charges are based on extortion, identity theft and conspiracy.
Here’s the arrest warrant which sets out more details of the investigation:
