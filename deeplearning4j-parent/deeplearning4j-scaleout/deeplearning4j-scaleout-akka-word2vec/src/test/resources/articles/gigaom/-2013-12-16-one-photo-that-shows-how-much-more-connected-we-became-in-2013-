Makes me wonder at what point we will peak, and to what extent the growing number of wearables will impact connectivity.  It can’t be far off that one device is the connected core – such as a wearable with anything else feeding off the one central device. This connectivity however is essentially as more organizations thrive to achieve mobile enterprise status.
