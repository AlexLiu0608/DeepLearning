Facebook may or may not have a problem with teens, but it is entrenched in mainstream American life, something none of its competitors in the social media space can match, according to new research from Pew Internet. However, internet users are increasingly branching out and using multiple services.
Among U.S. adults who get online regularly, 71 percent use Facebook, up from 67 percent in late 2012, Pew said Monday in a report . Increased usage was the story at several other sites as well, although in much smaller doses: LinkedIn usage went from 20 percent to 22 percent; Pinterest usage from 15 percent to 21 percent; Twitter usage from 16 percent to 18 percent; and Instagram (owned by Facebook) usage from 13 percent to 17 percent.
An important part of any advertising-based business is how often your users return to your site, and Facebook boasts the highest levels of daily usage as well: 63 percent of Facebook users visit the site daily, “with 40 percent logging on multiple times a day,” Pew said. And Instagram also enjoys a large percentage of daily users, with 57 percent of its users checking in daily. Forty-six percent of Twitter users check in daily, while only 23 percent of Pinterest users and just 13 percent of LinkedIn users do so.
Pew didn’t specifically address the question of whether or not Facebook is losing ground among the teen set, which is a hot topic at the moment . Among 18 to 29-year-olds, 84 percent told Pew they use Facebook, but earlier figures were not provided and users younger than 18 were not surveyed.
Another interesting tidbit in the report looked at how many users of one site also use another social media site. The matrix, provided below, shows why Twitter and Facebook were both very interested in acquiring Instagram last year.
