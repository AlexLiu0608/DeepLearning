Rumors are rumbling after two Italian newspapers “confirmed” that Amazon is somewhere in the process of acquiring payments startup GoPago , according to the  Wall Street Journal . GoPago’s CTO, Vincenzo di Nicola, told those newspapers that his startup has already been acquired, but he’s been mum on the issue since (as has Amazon). The “everything store” hasn’t made an overture into payments, dominated by Square and Paypal, in quite some time, so the quiet acquisition would be an interesting tell as to what the company will do next. But it’s best to wait until the giant speaks up.
