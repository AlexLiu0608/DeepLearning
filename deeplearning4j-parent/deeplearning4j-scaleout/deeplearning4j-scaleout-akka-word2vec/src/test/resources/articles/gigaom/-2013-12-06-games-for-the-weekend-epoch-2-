Summary:
Get your swiping finger in shape this weekend because this weeks game is all about action.  EPOCH.2 is a first rate action shooter that you will not want to miss.
Games for the Weekend is a weekly feature aimed at helping you avoid doing something constructive with your downtime. Each Friday we’ll be recommending a game for Mac, iPhone or iPad that we think is awesome. Here is one cool enough to keep you busy during this weekend.
EPOCH.2 ($5.99 Universal ) is a fast-paced action game where you are in control of a mechanized robot warrior that will do anything to save a longtime friend and princess.
As the second title in the series, the story line picks up where the first one left off. Princess Amelia is stuck in suspended animation with a single robot warrior standing between her and death. By projecting her thoughts telepathically‎, the princess is able to speak to the robot through a holographic representation of herself. This holograph also has access to the main computer and can issue command and control decisions that guide the gameplay. Princess Amelia drives the storyline by suggesting which missions to take on next.
Controlling the robot warrior is accomplished by a series of left, right, up and down swiping motions. To dodge an enemy’s attack, you can jump left and right. Swiping down will duck behind cover and swiping up will jump from one side of the screen to the other. Protecting the robot will not get you very far; you must also tap on which particular enemy you want to fire upon. The robot will then continue to fire upon that target until the target is destroyed or you tap on an alternate target. Even after completing a series of defensive moves, the enemy will remain targeted and the robot will continue to fire. There are also a series of tappable buttons in the screen that can be used to deploy missiles and grenades, as well as slow down time for a moment and give you a decisive advantage at a critical point in a battle.
As you play the game you also earn credits. Between each level you can use these credits to upgrade your robot. You can upgrade your weapons, armor, grenades, missiles and even your jet pack. Each upgrade comes in the form of a different armament. Set up like an arms dealer retail shop, you select each purchase based on the abilities of each item.  Once owned, the individual items themselves can’t be upgraded. If you do not have enough credits to get what you want, you can purchase credits through in app purchases which will only serve to accelerate your way through the lower levels. The weapons and armor your robot has equipped do affect how difficult or easy each level will be.
You can go back and replay previous levels in order to earn more credits and toughen up your robot for the next level of the campaign. Additionally there are thee modes you can play each level. The original campaign mode will play again just as it did the first time. In time trial mode, you race through each level trying to beat the clock. Fail to complete the level in time and your robot will explode. In iron mode you will face a much harder and more formidable enemy. These three modes make going backwards in the game just as much fun as playing forward.
The storyline unfolds as the two battling armies of mechanized robot warriors face off with one another. Each new level introduces some new obstacle to overcome in the form of a new enemy to fight, a new move to master, or a different environment to face.  The real gem of the game is its captivating battle mechanics that have you swiping your screen like crazy.  So be prepared to lose yourself this weekend as EPOCH.2 will have you on the edge of your seat, and your finger on the tip of your screen all weekend long.
