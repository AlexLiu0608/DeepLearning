Matter, the crowdfunded longform journalism startup that was acquired by Medium earlier this year, turned one year old last week and says it is making some changes to the service: It is removing the paywall it had around its content , making all articles — as well as audio versions and other features — free of charge, although it says it is planning a “membership scheme” so that it can reward its writers. It is also planning to boost its output from one longform article per month, although it didn’t say how much more frequently it would be publishing.
