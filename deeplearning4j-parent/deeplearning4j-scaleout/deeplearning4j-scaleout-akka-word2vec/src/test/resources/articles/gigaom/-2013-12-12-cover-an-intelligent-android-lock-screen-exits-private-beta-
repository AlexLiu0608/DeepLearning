After months of private beta status, Cover is now available in the Google Play Store . The free app, still in a public beta status, is a smart lock screen of sorts for Android devices, showing specific apps based on context such as time of day or location. That means apps you use at home would appear when your handset location is home as compared to work apps showing while at the office. Cover even learns which apps you use or would be most likely to use on the road, showing maps, music and messaging apps while in your car.
