Summary:
China is a hot bed of cloud activity. The latest entrant — China Unicom just  launched a full-service OpenStack cloud.
Watch out Amazon: China Unicom just launched what Web Hot Review is calling a “full-service”  OpenStack-based  cloud  under the Wo-Cloud brand.
The company will focus on “IaaS- and PaaS-level products for 3G, broadband, and public customers” with this public service cloud, China Unicom president Lu Yimin said in a statement, adding that “China Unicom will focus on IaaS- and PaaS-level products for 3G, broadband, and public customers by creating a public service cloud.”
On December 18, public cloud leader Amazon Web Services announced plans for a China service  operating out of a Beijing data center. IBM followed within hours with news that it was bringing SmartCloud Enterprise + to China as well in partnership with 21Vianet, a big carrier-neutral internet provider in China. Microsoft last year announced its own 21Vianet partnership to bring Windows Azure and Office 365 to China.
Wo-Cloud will face other formidable domestic competitors as well. Alibaba, the giant Chinese commerce provider’s Aliyun cloud division is expanding  its services inside China as well as  building a presence outside the country.
