Summary:
Bonjour and guten Tag: Netflix executives have visited Germany and France as they are looking for additional markets to launch their service.
Netflix may be looking to continental Europe for some of its planned international expansions in 2014: Netflix executives met with the staff of France’s president this week to discuss the regulatory environment in the country, and its impact on a possible launch of the company in France, according to a Reuters report . Netflix executives apparently also visited Germany and other countries on their trip to Europe.
Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said in a recent letter to investors ( PDF ) that he sees “a big international opportunity for Netflix,” and added on the company’s most recent earnings call that Netflix could generate as much as 80 percent of its total revenue outside of the U.S. in the future.
Netflix is now available in Canada, most of Latin America, the U.K. and Ireland, the Netherlands, Finland, Norway and Sweden. In 2014, the company plans to expand into multiple international markets, with Hastings saying that Netflix “definitely will be looking at some larger expansions.”
German and France make sense as targets for Netflix; the company already offers a French-language product to serve customers in Canada, and both Germany and France are huge broadband markets. However, regulatory challenges could complicate a launch in France in particular. Current rules mandate that movies can’t be available on on-demand markets until three years after they show up in theaters, according to Reuters.
A Netflix spokesperson declined to comment when contacted for this story.
