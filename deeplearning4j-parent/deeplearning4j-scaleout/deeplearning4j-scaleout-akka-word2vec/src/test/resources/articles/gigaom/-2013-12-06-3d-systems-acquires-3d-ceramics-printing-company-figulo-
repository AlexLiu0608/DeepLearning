Continuously striving to position itself as a 3D printing powerhouse, 3D Systems has acquired yet another company to add to its diverse portfolio of 3D printing technologies. With the acquisition of Figulo Corporation , the industry leader now possesses ceramics 3D printing technology.
Figulo, which operates a cloud-based ceramics printing service relying on technology rooted in 3D Systems ColorJet Printing (CJP), produces 3D printed ceramic objects for consumers, as well as architects, designers, and artists.  3D Systems plans to incorporate Figulo’s 3D printed ceramics into its Quickparts cloud-based 3D printing service and into its Cubify ecosystem, with the additional goal of commercializing Figulo’s own end-user ceramic 3D printers for those wishing to 3D print their own ceramic items.
Andrew Jeffery, President and CEO of Figulo Corporation, gave his reaction to the acquisition: “I couldn’t think of a better home for Figulo than 3DS. This is a dream combination of 3D Systems’ powerful CJP full color technology with Figulo’s extensive ceramic materials and process know-how to accelerate online and at home adoption and to unleash the full potential of professional and consumer ceramic 3D printing.”
CEO of 3DS, Avi Reichental, explained how the purchase would strengthen the company and ready ceramic 3D printing for the public, “With Figulo on board, we are enhancing both our Cubify and Quickparts capabilities and significantly expanding our materials and process expertise and know-how to fast track the commercialization of ceramic 3D printers. Ceramic 3D printing creates a unique experience for this time honored art form and is sure to induce a new breed of artists, designers and major décor labels to incorporate 3D printing into their professional toolbox while consumers enjoy the next dimension of décor and art.”
Since the acquisition, it seems that Figulo’s shop on Shapeways has been removed, which I suppose means that they will no longer be supplying 3D printed ceramics for the online service bureau, leaving Shapeways looking a little like the robot at this link . The good news is, maybe we’ll be able to buy our own 3D ceramic printers soon!
