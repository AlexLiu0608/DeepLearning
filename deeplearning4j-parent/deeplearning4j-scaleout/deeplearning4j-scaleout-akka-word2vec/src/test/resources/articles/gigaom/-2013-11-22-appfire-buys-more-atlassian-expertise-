Summary:
Acquisition of Bob Swift Software will give Appfire a good chunk of the Atlassian add-on business and help it grab market share.
Appfire , which provides services around Atlassian’s enterprise development and collaboration tools, is buying a leading provider of Atlassian add-ons.
The purchase of Bob Swift Software will give Appfire a software development business and a good chunk of the sales flowing through Atlassian’s online marketplace, said Randall Ward, CEO of Boston-based Appfire. That marketplace launched in early 2012, Bob Swift joined it in September of that year and, in 14 months, realized $1.2 million in revenue on those sales, he said. He did not disclose terms of the deal.
“Bob Swift specialized in add-ons for Confluence ,  Jira , Stash and Bamboo — some 35 products in all,” Ward said.
Atlassian, based in Sydney, Australia with U.S. offices in San Francisco, and claimed more than $150 million in revenue last year, and fields a range of tools including the  Stash  enterprise code repository;  Jira bug-tracker, and Confluence collaboration software.
Ward said  he expects other Atlassian partners will likely buy or merge to gain heft to take advantage of that what he sees as rising Atlassian sales at the expense of pricier options from IBM or Microsoft.
