Looking for a new Amazon tablet? Today is a good day for it, provided you’re quick on the draw. As part of its Cyber Monday specials, Amazon is discounting two of its Kindle Fire devices by $50 . The 16 GB Kindle Fire HD is $199 while the 7-inch Kindle Fire HDX is priced at $179, or $200 less than its larger 8.9-inch cousin. If you can splurge and will do more than just read books, I’d opt for the 7-inch HDX model due to the high-resolution screen – 1920 x 1200 resolution — and faster quad-core processor.
