Lady Gaga fans, get ready to fire up your torrent clients: BitTorrent Inc. and VICE Media are about to release a BitTorrent bundle that promises to go behind the scenes of Gaga’s latest music video, Do What U Want, featuring R. Kelly and directed by Terry Richardson. BitTorrent announced the collaboration with a blog post Tuesday , which reads in part:
“The Lady Gaga X BitTorrent Bundle features never-before-seen 4K footage documenting the making of Lady Gaga and R. Kelly’s “Do What U Want” music video, directed by Terry Richardson. It also includes an exclusive video interview with Lady Gaga and Richardson, led by VICE Editor-in-Chief Rocco Castoro.”
The bundle is going to be available online in early December.
This is the first manifestation of a new collaboration between BitTorrent Inc. and VICE, which was first announced in October . BitTorrent bundles are essentially promotional download packages, which give artists the option to offer content for free after users have signed up with their email address.
