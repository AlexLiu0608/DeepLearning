Summary:
Samsung has reportedly enlisted Catcher Technology, the same company behind the HTC One and new iPad mini bodies, to build a metal case for the Galaxy S 5.
After four generations of plastic, the evidence is building that Samsung might finally be using metal for the body of the Galaxy S 5. The most recent report, discovered by Phone Arena , cites Taiwan publication UDN . According to the report, Samsung has tapped Catcher Technology to produce a metal chassis for the GS 5.
Catcher Technology is the Taiwan-based aluminum and magnesium housing provider that supplied the bodies for Apple’s new iPad mini with retina display and the HTC One . So if this report is true, it is very good news for Samsung fans, as the iPad mini and HTC One feature some of the best builds I’ve seen.
That’s the only new information available in this report. Other than that, details remain slim, though so far the phone has been rumored to feature a 16-megapixel rear camera, 64-bit octo-core processor and a 2560 x 1440 display. An earlier rumored pegged a January announcement date , but now the spring is looking more likely .
