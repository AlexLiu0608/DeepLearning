Summary:
In the aftermath of the NSA controversy, solutions offering FIPS 140-2 cryptography are in high demand, driven by increased end user awareness and buyer requirements. SafeLogic’s technology can’t turn back time, but vendors are embracing the opportunity to satisfy customers by deploying FIPS-compliant encryption within days.
To combat customer fears regarding security, proactive vendors have found solace in FIPS 140-2 validated cryptography as the key differentiator. Black marks on the industry’s record are covered by the media like never before, and breaches such as compromised HIPAA data seem to happen regularly, casting doubt upon many supposed solutions. Independently validated encryption brings credibility and assurance to an otherwise turbulent landscape.
As a result, demand for FIPS solutions has grown exponentially, exposing a key flaw. The Cryptographic Module Validation Program ( CMVP ) has limited resources, yielding a 10-month ( and growing ) wait list for certification. Add time for document preparation and algorithm validation, and the timeline approaches a full calendar year — long enough to render technology obsolete by the time it’s validated. This delay creates an unavoidable dilemma for buyers: Purchase a product that’s out of date or one that hasn’t been validated at all?
“That’s just not a fair choice,” says SafeLogic  CEO Ray Potter . “Buyers need validated solutions, but it shouldn’t have to be at the expense of staying on the cutting edge.”
SafeLogic has tackled this very problem. By licensing its FIPS-validated CryptoComply  module, vendors can have an OEM solution within days and satisfy many buyers immediately. To meet mandates for customized validation, SafeLogic offers RapidCert , an accelerated turnkey program for the entire documentation, testing and validation process. In tandem with CryptoComply, vendors never have to worry about losing a customer because of the CMVP queue again!
Validated, innovative products delivered promptly. This is the future of encryption.
