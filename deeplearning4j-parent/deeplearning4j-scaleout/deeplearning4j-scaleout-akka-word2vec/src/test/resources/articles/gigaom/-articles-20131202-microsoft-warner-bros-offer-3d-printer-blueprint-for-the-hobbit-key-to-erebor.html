Microsoft & Warner Bros offer 3D printer blueprint for [The Hobbit] 'Key to Erebor'
Dec.2, 2013
To support the 13th December release of The Hobbit : Desolation of Smaug , Microsoft and Warner Bros announced the launch of a new cross-platform campaign and are offering a free 3D printer blueprint of The Key of Erebor from the film.
The ad campaign will run across Windows 8, MSN, Xbox 360, with an interactive, deep-dive into the film, including information about key characters, events and artefacts from the movie, actor biographies, behind-the-scenes videos and desktop wallpapers available for download.
The most interesting part is a 3D printer blueprint. The campaign will also offer Hobbit fans a free blueprint download for a 3D-printed model of "The Key to Erebor" – a major artefact in the film's plot. Fans will be invited to produce their very own collectable memorabilia from The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug for the cost of the print. The download will become available on the day the film is released: 13th December 2013.
Owen Sagness, General Manager for Microsoft Advertising & Online UK, says: "By offering fans a blueprint for a 3D model of one of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug's 'key' artefacts, we're providing a genuinely valuable and unique experience that puts the consumer first, while continuing to deliver for the client and push the boundaries of what is creatively possible using new technology."
