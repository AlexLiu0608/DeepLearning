Motorola and Verizon Wireless have a sweet treat in store for many users today, in the form of Android 4.4 KitKat updates. Verizon on Thursday tweeted that KitKat is now rolling out to the Motorola Droid Maxx, Mini and Ultra.
This is noteworthy because I’m pretty sure these are the first carrier-specific devices to see a KitKat update. So far KitKat has only come to the Moto X, Nexus, and Google Play edition devices. This latest update lineup isn’t surprising though, given that Google owns Motorola and these phones use nearly identical hardware components to the Moto X. But it is becoming increasingly apparent that, short of a Nexus or Google Play edition device, if you want to see an update delivered to your phone in a relatively reasonable time frame, Motorola might be the manufacturer to choose.
The update is being pushed out in phases, so if you haven’t seen it yet, it should appear shortly.
