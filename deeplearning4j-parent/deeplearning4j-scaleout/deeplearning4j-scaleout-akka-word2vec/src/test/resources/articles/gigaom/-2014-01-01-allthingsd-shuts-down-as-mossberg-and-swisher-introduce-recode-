On the last day of 2013, Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg announced that their website, AllThingsD, would be shut down in the wake of the September deal breakdown with owner Dow Jones . Then, at the stroke of midnight, the pair popped up with their newest venture, Re/code , to launch at midnight on January 2. Not much is known about the venture, or if it will differ much from ATD’s format. Speaking of ATD, its domain name now redirects to the Wall Street Journal’s new tech offering , fittingly titled WSJ.D , and is currently subject to the paper’s paywall.
