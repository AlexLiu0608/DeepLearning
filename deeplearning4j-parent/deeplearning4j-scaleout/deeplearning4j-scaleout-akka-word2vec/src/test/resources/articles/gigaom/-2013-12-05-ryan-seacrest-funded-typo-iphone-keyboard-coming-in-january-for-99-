Summary:
Can’t live without a good QWERTY keyboard but still want to use an iPhone? Neither can Ryan Seacrest who backed the Typo iPhone Keyboard, a $99 slide-on accessory with backlit keys that uses Bluetooth to communicate with your iPhone 5 or 5s.
Even after six years, some folks just can’t get used to the software keyboard of an iPhone. How else do you explain the Typo iPhone Keyboard , a $99 accessory that’s backed by Hollywood’s Ryan Seacrest? After two years in development — spawned by Seacrest tired of carrying two phones all the time — the Typo iPhone Keyboard arrives in mid-January and is now available for pre-order.
This isn’t the first such iPhone accessory to hit the market, but it looks more promising than most; particularly if you are or were a happy BlackBerry smartphone user. In fact, I wonder what the BlackBerry folks think of the Typo, since it it looks extremely similar to what you’d find on an old ‘Berry. Take a look:
The backlit keyboard connects to an iPhone 5 or 5s through a Bluetooth connection and actually doubles as a case for your handset. Made in two pieces, the Typo completely covers the back of an iPhone when the two halves are connected. The keyboard still provides access to the iPhone’s microphone, speaker and lightning connector dock. And it reportedly provides 40 percent more display since the software keyboard won’t be taking up space on-screen.
A review unit of the Typo iPhone Keyboard is on the way, so I’ll see how it works and report back in.
