Despite increased competition from IBM with its new SoftLayer franchise  and other players, Amazon Web Services continues to lead the combined pack in cloud revenue, according to new Synergy Research Group numbers . The figures, which combine Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service revenues in one big bucket, showed AWS grew a whopping 55 percent in an overall market that grew 46 percent.
Once again, revenue from AWS  alone was bigger than that of all the listed competitors combined although all the major vendors showed growth.
Here are some caveats:  Accounting for cloud revenue (let alone profit) is an extremely slippery business, since none of the big companies make it easy for outside number crunchers. Also, figuring out a dividing line between IaaS and PaaS is another world of hurt. But here’s what Synergy came up with:
By Synergy’s measure, total IaaS/PaaS revenues for the quarter passed $2.5 billion with IaaS making up 64 percent of the total. Within IaaS alone, AWS accounted for 35 percent of the market; IBM 7 percent; and “everyone else” less than 3 percent each. In PaaS, Salesforce.com–with its Force.com and Heroku soon to be joined by  Heroku1 –had an 18 percent share; AWS 17 percent; Microsoft 14 percent; Google 13 percent; and everyone else less than 5 percent each. 
There are some pretty bold-faced names missing. It’s probably not a huge deal that most of the OpenStack vendors don’t show up, but is it surprising that Rackspace once again did not make the cut? I don’t know. I’m just glad someone’s willing to take a stab at this sticky calculation.
For comparison purposes, here’s the Synergy chart (minus Salesforce.com) from the second quarter.
Note: This story was updated at 2:48 p.m. PT to reflect that while AWS still leads all comers in overall IaaS/PaaS revenue according to Synergy Research, all the leading players tracked also showed growth.
