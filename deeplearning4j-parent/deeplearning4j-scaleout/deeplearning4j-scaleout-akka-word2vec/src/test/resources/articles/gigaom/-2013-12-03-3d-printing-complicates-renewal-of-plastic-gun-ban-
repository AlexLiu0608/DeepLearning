Guns that can’t be detected by an X-ray machines or metal detector are forbidden under a 25-year-old law, but the law is set to expire on Monday and a debate over 3D printing is complicating efforts to renew it.
While both parties in Congress support the existing ban, Democrats are concerned over plastic weapons that can be printed with 3D technology and that contain a detachable, superfluous piece of metal.
Some Democrats regard plastic guns with removable metal as a way to circumvent the ban, and want the renewed law to include language that would require all plastic guns to include a permanent piece of metal inside them. Some gun advocates, however, are opposing the proposal as a way to stifle the development of gun technology, according to the AP .
The debate over 3D-printed guns has taken on new urgency after a Texas law student successfully fired a printed plastic pistol earlier this year. And in late November, Philadelphia became the first city to pass a law banning printed guns.
As for the federal ban, Congress is expected to pass the renewal by early next week, but it’s unclear if it will be a long-term extension of the current ban — which Republicans want — or just a one-year extension, proposed by Sen Chuck Schumer (D-NY), that will require lawmakers to address 3D gun technology.
