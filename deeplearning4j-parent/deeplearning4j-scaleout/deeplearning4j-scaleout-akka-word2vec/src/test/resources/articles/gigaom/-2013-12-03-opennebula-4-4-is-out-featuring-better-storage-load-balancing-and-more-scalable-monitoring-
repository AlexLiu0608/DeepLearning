Summary:
The new version of the open-source cloud management platform, codenamed “Retina”, introduces the ability to define scheduling policies for storage load-balancing.
The OpenNebula project just released the nineteenth version of its open-source enterprise cloud management platform, OpenNebula “Retina” 4.4.
The big feature of this release is its support for multiple system data stores, which means administrators can add a second datastore if the first gets full, and which also allows defined scheduling policies for the distribution of virtual machines across multiple data stores, VMware DRS -style.
OpenNebula 4.4 also features a new monitoring driver that employs a push rather than pull model , where hosts send monitoring data to the front-end rather than the front-end having to ask. This should make OpenNebula’s monitoring subsystem more scalable.
The other big changes are on the Amazon interaction front. Cloud bursting to Amazon is apparently more efficient now, partly due to a switch from Amazon API Tools to the AWS software development kit for Ruby, and partly because OpenNebula users can now define various EC2 hosts. The OpenNebula econe-server, a component that interprets Amazon EC2 API calls, has also been tweaked.
