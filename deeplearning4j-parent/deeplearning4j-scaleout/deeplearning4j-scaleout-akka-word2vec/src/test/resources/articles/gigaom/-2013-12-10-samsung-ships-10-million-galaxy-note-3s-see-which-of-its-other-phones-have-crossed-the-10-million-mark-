Samsung on Tuesday announced that global shipments of its Galaxy Note 3 smartphone have surpassed the 10 million mark just two months after its release. That makes it the fastest moving Note device yet. Not bad for the “phablet” category, which practically didn’t exist until a couple of years ago.
But the Note 3 is just the latest device to join the ranks of Samsung’s “10 Million Seller Club.” The company posted an infographic today that dates all the way back to 2002 and the SGH-T100 flip phone, Samsung’s first mobile device to move 10 million units.
Sure, the graphic is more than a little hubristic (with a spot already saved for next year’s entry), but it’s also a fascinating look at how quickly cell phones have evolved. From flip phones and sliders through 2008, to the arrival of the touchscreen, Haptic-UI based GT-S520 Star in 2009. Android doesn’t make its arrival until 2010, in the form of the original Galaxy S handset.
It’s a pretty steady stream of Google-powered hits from there, with every entry in the Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S and Galaxy Note series reaching the coveted 10 million mark. It’ll be interesting to see where things go from here, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see the forthcoming  Galaxy S 5 occupy that reserved spot on the list.
