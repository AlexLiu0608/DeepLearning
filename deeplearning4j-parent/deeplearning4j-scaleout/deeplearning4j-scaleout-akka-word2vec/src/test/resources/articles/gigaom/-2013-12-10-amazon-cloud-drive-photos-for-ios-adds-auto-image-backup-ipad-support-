With just 5GB of free storage, Amazon(s amzn) might not be the best place for iOS users to store data, but it has become a better place than before to keep photos and videos. The latest iteration of the app, version 2.0, adds automatic backup to iPhones, iPads and iPod touch devices . Videos are limited to 20 minutes in length if the auto-save option is enabled. Apple’s own PhotoStream is the more likely option for images in the cloud; however, those memories rotate out as Apple’s 1,000 image limit is hit. Perhaps Amazon’s online option isn’t a bad backup plan if you’re not already using Dropbox for the same function?
