Summary:
If these benchmark results are for the Galaxy S5, expect it be an absolute beast of a phone.
The Galaxy S5 rumors have started swirling , though so far there has been little mentioned in the way of specs. But new benchmark results posted on GFXBench might give us a clue. And if these results are indeed for the Galaxy S5, it might truly be a phone without equal when it arrives.
The thing is, it isn’t clear which phone these benchmarks are for. The page says “3D Graphics Performance of Samsung SM-G900S.” That could be the Galaxy S5. It could also be the Galaxy Note 4. It might even be a demo device, or worse yet, a fake. So don’t get your hopes up too high just yet, even though what you see in the chart below is awfully impressive.
Of course, the software build listed here is Android 4.4 KitKat , which is pretty much a given. There might be a new dot release by the time the Galaxy S5 makes it to market, but I wouldn’t expect it to ship with anything less than Android 4.4.
More interesting is that the device features 2560 x 1440 resolution. This means that if it maintains the same 5-inch display size as the Galaxy S4, it’ll work out to an astonishing 587 pixels per inch. More likely though, is that the display will grow a bit larger. Samsung said to expect devices with 560ppi in 2014 . Android Authority did the math, and that works out to a 5.25-inch screen. If such a monster exists, I’m sure it’ll need an equally impressive battery to power it.
Then there’s the processor, which is listed as a Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM8974, running at a 2457MHz clock speed. Since that’s faster than the 2.3GHz limit of the Snapdragon 800, it could mean the phone is using Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 805 chip. That would dispel early rumors of an octo-core processor , but then again, Samsung might release two separate versions of the phone like it did for the Galaxy S4.
So while it’s unclear if the specs we’re seeing here are for the Galaxy S5, I can’t help but hope so. Then again, the phone isn’t expected to be announced until next spring , so I’m sure we’ll see many of these figures change before then.
