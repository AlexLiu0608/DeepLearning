Summary:
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was deemed one of the worst video games of all times, and legend has it that Atari buried all copies in shame. Now, Microsoft wants to dig them up.
Microsoft has secured the exclusive rights for a documentary series that wants to “expose how the digital revolution created a global democracy of information, entertainment and commerce,” according to  Xbox Entertainment Studios President Nancy Tellem.
Not sure what that means? Me neither, but Microsoft decided to give us a clue by telling us about the first episode, on which production is going to begin in January.
In it, Microsoft and its production partner Lightbox are planning to quite literally get to the bottom of one of the biggest legends in video game history: Film maker Zak Penn will start digging up a landfill in New Mexico to search for thousands of lost cartridges of the game E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial that Atari supposedly buried there in the middle of the night some 30 years ago after the title was deemed one of the worst games of all times.
Microsoft wants to exclusively distribute the series on Xbox One and Xbox 360 worldwide. Tellem said earlier this year that the company planned to make its shows more interactive by using the Xbox Kinect sensor, but it’s unclear whether any of these interactive elements will be part of this new documentary series.
