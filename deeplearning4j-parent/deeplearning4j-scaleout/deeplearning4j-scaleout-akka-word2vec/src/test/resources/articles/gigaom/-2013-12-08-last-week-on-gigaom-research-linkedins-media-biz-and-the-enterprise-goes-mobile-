Mobile:  The impact of mobility on enterprise software development
Aileen Arcilla
Analyst Aileen Arcilla looks at how the BYOD movement is transforming “employee expectations of enterprise application design, functionality, and provisioning.” While consumer software developers have already embraced a mobile-first philosophy with intuitive, clear UIs, enterprise software products and vendors have lagged significantly. Arcilla analyzes the growth and divergence of these two markets, and highlights use cases of progressive developers who have embraced leading consumer trends in their enterprise app development pipeline, as well as its potential near-term impact for independent software developers and their end users.
Social:  How LinkedIn is evolving its media business
Lydia Loizedes
In her latest report, analyst Lydia Loizedes looks at LinkedIn two years after their big IPO.  With a reported 238 million registered users and massive reported global growth as of Q3 2013, LinkedIn has established itself as the “go-to professional social network and proprietor of social professional identity.” With three core channels of revenue, the company has made a series of strategic acquisitions that include Slideshare and Pulse, and its only direct competitors are localized products in international markets. Loizedes analyzes LinkedIn’s existing products and services, focusing on its media and ad revenue model; the company’s focus on leveraging content to advance marketing revenue will ultimately drive LinkedIn’s next stage of growth. Loizedes looks at the specific technologies and products that will play a key role in this growth, and takes a look at where LinkedIn should go next.

Stowe Boyd
It’s holiday crunch time, which means that Stowe Boyd’s latest weekly update has particular resonance with a lot of our readers. Boyd breaks down the actual definition of work-related burnout, and looks at Christina Maslach’s Burnout Inventory, a method for assessing and itemizing the individual factors that contribute to burnout as a way of managing and mitigating burnout in a proactive manner. Boyd cautions that addressing these issues now is a mandatory step towards warding off a more endemic burnout situation in the workplace.
