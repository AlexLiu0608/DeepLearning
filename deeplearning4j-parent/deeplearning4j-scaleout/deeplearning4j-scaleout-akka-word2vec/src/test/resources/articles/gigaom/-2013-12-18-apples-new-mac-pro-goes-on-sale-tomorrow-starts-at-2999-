Summary:
Get ready to add one more item to your holiday wish list. Apple has announced that its new Mac Pro goes on sale starting Thursday, December 19.
I now know what I want for Christmas. Apple’s gorgeous new Mac Pro goes on sale starting tomorrow, Thursday, December 19. That means you should be able to bring one home in time for the holidays – if you’ve got the cash, that is. Apple’s ultra-high-end new computer starts at a whopping $2,999, and goes up quickly from there.
Designed around a unified thermal core, the new Mac Pro packs an incredible amount of power into an aluminum enclosure that’s just 9.9-inches – it’s one-eighth the volume of the previous generation. It actually looks a lot like an artistic modern wastepaper basket, if that’s your sort of thing. But that innovation comes at a a price. Here’s a quick breakdown of the configurations available:
The base model features a 3.7 GHz quad-core Intel Xeon E5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.9 GHz, dual AMD FirePro D300 GPUs with 2GB of VRAM each, 12GB of memory and 256GB of PCIe-based flash storage starting at $2,999.
Then there’s a 3.5 GHz 6-core Intel Xeon E5 processor with Turbo Boost speeds up to 3.9 GHz, dual AMD FirePro D500 GPUs with 3GB of VRAM each, 16GB of memory and 256GB of PCIe-based flash storage starting at $3,999.
You can also configure your machine to order, with options that include faster 8-core or 12-core Intel Xeon E5 processors, AMD FirePro D700 GPUs with 6GB of VRAM, up to 64GB of memory and up to 1TB of PCIe-based flash storage.
You can find additional specs, configure-to-order options and accessories directly from Apple .
