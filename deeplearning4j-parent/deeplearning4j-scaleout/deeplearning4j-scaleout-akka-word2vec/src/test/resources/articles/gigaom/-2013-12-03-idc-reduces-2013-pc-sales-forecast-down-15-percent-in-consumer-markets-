Although there’s no data from IDC to support it, the 15 percent PC sales drop in the consumer market is likely impacted heavily by alternatives to new PCs: tablets. IDC says that Windows tablet sales will approach 39.3 million by 2017, but in a market with 300 million current sales, it won’t help the PC market that much.
The research firm notes that people still spend more hours of their day actually using a PC than smartphones or tablets. That’s not going to save the industry though:
“PC usage is nonetheless declining each year as more devices become available. And despite industry efforts, PC usage has not moved significantly beyond consumption and productivity tasks to differentiate PCs from other devices. As a result, PC lifespans continue to increase, thereby limiting market growth.”
Trends suggest computing usage is changing and has been for the past few years. Clearly there are still some tasks today that require a full PC but the most basic tasks that people do the most are easily manageable on a tablet or even a smartphone. Think of activities such as email, casual gaming, browsing the web, consuming audio or video content; mobile devices are fine for these, if not even preferred because they can be done practically anywhere.
It’s expected that annual tablet sales will top PC sales in 2014; it’s likely even that this takes place in the final quarter of 2013. So I may have been off by a year when I dug deeper into this trend back in February 2012 in a piece for Gigaom Research. Seeing the writing on the wall, I suggested that the “PC” you buy in three years won’t be “PC” at all (subscription required). It’s a shame that some of the PC makers — and Microsoft too, for that matter — didn’t see the same writing.
