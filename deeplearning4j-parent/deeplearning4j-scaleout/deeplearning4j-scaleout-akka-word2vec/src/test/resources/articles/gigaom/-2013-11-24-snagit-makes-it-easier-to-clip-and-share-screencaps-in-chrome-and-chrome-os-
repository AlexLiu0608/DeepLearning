Summary:
Looking for a better screen capture app for Chrome or Chrome OS? Consider SnagIt from TechSmith. It’s both an app and an extension; the two work together for capturing images, annotating them and then syncing them up to your Google Drive.
Our weekly Chrome Show podcast always includes a recommended Chrome app or extension; this week we shared one of each. SnagIt from TechSmith is available as both an app and extension. The two work in tandem so you can easily capture a screenshot in Chrome, annotate it and have it sync up to your Google Drive account.
In our most recent podcast episode we also chat about a rumored new touchscreen Chromebook from Acer, the latest Chrome OS software updates and a first look at folder support in the Chrome App launcher. Tune by downloading this week’s show here or listening directly below.
