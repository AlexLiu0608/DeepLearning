Apple is free to continue selling the iPhone and iPad in South Korea after a Seoul court dismissed a lawsuit that Apple was in violation of three of Samsung’s mobile patents. Reuters reports that a judge at the Seoul Central District Court on Thursday ruled that Apple’s devices didn’t violate Samsung’s patents on short message display and message grouping features. Samsung was seeking a ban on the sale of Apple products as well as 100 million won (about $95,100 USD). “We are glad the Korean court joined others around the world in standing up for real innovation and rejecting Samsung’s ridiculous claims,” Apple Korea spokesman Steve Park said.
