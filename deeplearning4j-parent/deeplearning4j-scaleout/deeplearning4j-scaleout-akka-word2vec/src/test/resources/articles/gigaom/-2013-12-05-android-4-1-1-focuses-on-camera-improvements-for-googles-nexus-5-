Summary:
Good news for Nexus 5 owners who aren’t happy with the device’s camera: Android 4.4.1 will noticeably improve image quality and the overall speed of the camera app. The software is rolling out over the next few days.
Nexus 5 owners who aren’t too happy with their phone’s camera should get some relief — and better pictures — soon. Android 4.4.1 addresses some of the camera software and image processing issues that are holding back the Nexus 5 from taking great images and Google is rolling out that update in the next few days, according to The Verge.
What’s better about it? The app itself is faster overall and that includes the time it takes for auto-focus to work its magic. Look for improvements in white balance and exposure as well thanks to how quick the camera software is able to understand its surroundings to make the appropriate adjustments.
After using the new software for a day, The Verge’s verdict is that images are much better and it has a gallery of before and after shots to show the difference. My eyes see improved contrast and color saturation in the sample images and I’m looking forward to testing the faster app as soon as it comes my way.
