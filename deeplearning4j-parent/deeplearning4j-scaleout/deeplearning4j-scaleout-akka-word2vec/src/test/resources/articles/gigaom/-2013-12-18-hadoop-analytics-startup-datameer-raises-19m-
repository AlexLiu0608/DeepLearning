Datameer , one of the first companies to offer software for easily analyzing data stored in Hadoop (it lets users use a spreadsheet interface to work with data), has raised a $19 million series D round of venture capital. Next World Capital led the round, which also included its existing investors and Workday, Citi Ventures and Software AG. Datameer has proven pretty resilient even as other early Hadoop-ecosystem startups have suffered, in part I assume because it been proactive on product design — it was quick to adopt HTML5 and add advanced visualization options — and getting the product in potential users’ hands via single-node and laptop versions of the product.
