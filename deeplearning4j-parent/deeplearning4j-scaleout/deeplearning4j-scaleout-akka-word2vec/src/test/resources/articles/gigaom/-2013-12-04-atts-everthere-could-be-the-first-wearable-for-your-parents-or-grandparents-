Summary:
Seniors may not be the prime audience for Google Glass or a smartwatch but a wearable for remote monitoring may appeal. AT&T’s EverThere is exactly that, calling for help in case of a fall and providing GPS data to first responders.
Is there a connected wearable device market for the senior crowd? Surprise: There sure is given that one in three adults over the age of 65 in North America fall every year. For years, monitoring services have been there for those on the floor and now AT&T is getting in on the game with EverThere .
The small, rechargable device is smart enough to detect a fall which will trigger it to automatically alert a 7 x 24 call center through its two-way voice communications. The EverThere also has a GPS radio which can help first responders find the wearer if needed. Of course, this peace of mind doesn’t quite come cheap although it appears resonable when compared to the incumbents in this market.
AT&T is charging $29.99 a month for the monthly monitoring service; that’s actually a little less than one major monitoring service I checked out. If any readers currently pay for a similar service I’d love to hear how AT&T’s fee compares; most companies in this space are, shall we say “less than transparent” when it comes to the service fees.
As far as the EverThere, it costs $99.99 up-front with an annual contract or $199.99 without a contract commitment or cancellation fee.
