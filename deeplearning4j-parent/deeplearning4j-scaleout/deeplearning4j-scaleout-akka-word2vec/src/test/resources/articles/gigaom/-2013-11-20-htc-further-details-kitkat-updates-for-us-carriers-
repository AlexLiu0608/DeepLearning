Summary:
HTC has revealed that Android 4.4 KitKat should hit all One phones in the US by the end of January, with an update for the Droid DNA to follow.
HTC has already delivered its KitKat update for the Google Play Edition of the HTC One to Google, but there’s still a lot of work to be done before it can roll out to all of the carrier-branded Ones out there. According to HTC on Twitter, the OEM is working on getting Android 4.4 pushed out to all HTC Ones on North American carriers by the end of January .
There was some concern about this, since there’s been a delay updating the Verizon One to HTC 4.3 Jelly Bean. But HTC says this update “does not impact delivery of 4.4 by end of Janaury – still on track.” The Android 4.3 Jelly Bean update is rolling out to Verizon customers now. It’s a two-step process, with a compatibility update taking place this week, and the actual OS update happening in December.
The reason that carrier-branded updates are taking longer than the Google Play Edition is because HTC needs to apply its own layer of Sense software to the OS – something it doesn’t do for the Play phones.
In addition to the One, HTC also said that it is planning a KitKat update for the Droid DNA by the end of Q1, pending certification from Verizon. While it seems like two months or more is a long time to wait, this is still better than many other manufacturers. Samsung, for instance, still hasn’t announced a KitKat update for popular devices like the Galaxy S 4.
