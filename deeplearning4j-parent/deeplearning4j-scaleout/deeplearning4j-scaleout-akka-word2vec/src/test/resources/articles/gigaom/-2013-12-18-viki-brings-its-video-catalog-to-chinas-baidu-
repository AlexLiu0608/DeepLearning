Viki , the international streaming video service that recently got acquired by Japan’s Rakuten , just took a big step into the Chinese market: Viki is supplying Baidu with movies and TV shows from a variety of countries including South Korea, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., which will be available with ads on Baidu’s site as well as through the company’s mobile apps. U.S. fare will come from the Cartoon Network and other Turner channels. Viki CEO and co-founder Razmig Hovaghimian told me recently that global expansion is a big part of his plans for 2014.
