Summary:
The touch web is pretty good on mobile browsers, but it’s a slightly different story when you start tapping around on a desktop browser. We share the experience on this week’s Chrome Show podcast, along with a recap of all things Chrome.
Mobile devices might now account for 20 percent of global web usage , but the experience on a tablet can still be frustrating. I found that out with an ongoing experiment to create my own Chrome OS slate using readily available devices . Using an Asus Transformer T100, for example, I can get the Chrome OS look and feel on a 10.1-inch Windows 8 tablet. And there are still some controls that are better suited for a mouse or trackpad. Mobile browsers tend to work a little better in this regard, but using full desktop browser on a tablet can be a chore at times.
We cover some of that experience on this week’s audio podcast , along with some discussion on Google’s big Chrome App developer push, new Chromecast channels made available recently, and explain how easy it is to replace the SSD module in an Acer C720 Chromebook. The show is available for download here or you can listen directly below.
