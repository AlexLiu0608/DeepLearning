Summary:
After its September introduction, the Oppo N1 launches later this month for $599. Without LTE, this phone could be a tough sell in the U.S. but some may overlook that in favor of pre-installed CyanogenMod software.
The handy CyanogenMod (CM) install app for Android is no longer available the Google Play Store , however that isn’t stopping Oppo from releasing its N1 flagship phone with CM pre-installed. The company is making good on its promised December release date , announcing on Google+ that the Oppo N1 will be available for $599 on December 10 .
Oppo doesn’t specifically state that the phone will run on the custom CM software but the included image in the announcement clearly shows the CM logo. It’s a fairly safe bet that the handset doesn’t run stock Android as a result.
In terms of hardware, the N1 was cutting-edge when it debuted in September although some more current phones have a faster chip. Oppo chose Qualcomm’s 1.7 GHz Snapdragon 600 paired with 2 GB of memory. The phone has a large 5.9-inch 1080p display, 13 megapixel camera that swivels from front to back and a touch panel on the back.
According to Oppo, the N1 supports 850/900/1800/1900MHz GSM frequencies and 850/900/1700/1900/2100MHz WCDMA frequencies so it should work on both the AT&T and T-Mobile networks here in the U.S. There is no mention, however of an LTE radio in the N1.
