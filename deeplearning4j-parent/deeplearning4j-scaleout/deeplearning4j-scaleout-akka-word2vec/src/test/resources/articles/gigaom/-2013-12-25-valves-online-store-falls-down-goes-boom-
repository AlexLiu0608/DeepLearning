It may not be on par with the great Netflix snafu  of Christmas Eve 2012 but gamers are pretty ticked off that the Valve Software’s online store fell down during a Christmas sale, according to Geekwire, Reddit and other outlets . A traffic spike may have been an issue: Valve offered a free copy of Left 4 Dead 2 to anyone who downloaded and installed it before 10 a.m. PST December 26. As of 6:15 p.m. Christmas night the store appeared to be up again.
