Summary:
Everyone from BuzzFeed to the Washington Post seems to be chasing after viral content because of the traffic it brings — but all this does is reinforce how doomed the pageview-based model really is

Everyone seems to want to generate content that will go “viral” nowadays — to the point where a new site specializing in that kind of content, such as Upworthy or ViralNova, seems to come along every week. Even some traditional media outlets like the Washington Post have launched their own sites to try and ride this wave to the promised land, and they appear to be having some success (depending on how you define success).
That said, however, I would argue that these sites and services are focused on a short-term strategy at best — and one that is ultimately self-defeating. Why? Because they only serve to reinforce the flawed view that traffic is all that matters.
It’s also worth pointing out that generating — or at least finding and sharing — viral content isn’t exactly rocket science: as The Wire pointed out in a recent piece, a twenty-something entrepreneur named Scott DeLong effectively created ViralNova singlehandedly at his home in Ohio, and now routinely produces new viral sensations. He clearly works hard at understanding how this works from an algorithmic standpoint, but it doesn’t seem terribly complicated.
The war for pageviews continues
Neetzan Zimmerman at Gawker, meanwhile, has turned his ability to spot viral content into a marketable skill — he produces as many pageviews himself (up to 35 million in a single month, according to a recent profile in the Wall Street Journal) as some entire media outlets do with large teams. And he is the chief weapon in an ongoing traffic war: in a recent internal memo, Gawker founder Nick Denton grumbled about how his site had fallen behind BuzzFeed, and how Upworthy — which he described as “even smarmier than BuzzFeed” — was nipping at his heels.
It’s not surprising that some have compared this to the early days of SEO or search-engine optimization, when online publishers would stuff their pages and headlines full of keywords in the hope that Google would boost their ranking.
In the end, the impulse to find or build portals around viral content is driven by the same motivation as SEO was — namely, to produce vast numbers of pageviews that can be sold to advertisers. And just like SEO, the engineering of Upworthy or BuzzFeed-style headlines and content has already become a cliche , to the point where it may actually stop working, even without any intervention from Google.
But pageview-chasing is a mug’s game
But even if the content itself continues to work — in the sense that people will always want to share photos of otters holding hands or cats that look like Franklin Delano Roosevelt — the value of those millions of pageviews is continuing to drop. That’s not just because there are more and more sites doing it, but because the value of incremental pageviews is sinking inexorably towards zero.
That means that every site using viral content as a growth engine is ultimately running the Red Queen’s race from Alice in Wonderland — the one where you have to run as hard as you can just to stay in the same place.
In part, the blame for this state of affairs lies at the feet of the advertising industry, which continues to focus on big pageviews numbers even as it claims to be more interested in engagement and other metrics. And it’s true that the entertainment value of slide shows and cat GIFs is often worthwhile for its own sake — but ultimately, publishers who try to game the system by focusing on cheap viral content aren’t helping themselves in the long run.
