Happy holidays, Nexus fans. @GooglePlay just tweeted that, starting today, when you order a Nexus 7 tablet from Google online, you’ll get free shipping and $25 in credit to the Google Play app store for a limited time.
A quick peek at the Nexus 7 purchase page reveals the deal front and center. You’ll get the $25 in credit no matter what model you buy, and it will be emailed to you when your tablet ships. The deal is for U.S. customers only, and there’s no word on when the promotion will end, though you must apply the credit to your play account by March 31, 2014 and use it by March 31, 2015.
Despite the minor stipulations, now would be a good time to buy a Nexus 7 if you were thinking about it.
