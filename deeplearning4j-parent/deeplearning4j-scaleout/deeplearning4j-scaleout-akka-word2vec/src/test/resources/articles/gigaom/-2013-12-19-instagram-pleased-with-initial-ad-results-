Instagram released a blog post on Thursday detailing the results from its foray into advertising content , which rolled out on November 1, and it seems like the company is happy with the data. The company pulled research from the first four programs, with standout data coming from Levi’s and Ben & Jerry’s: the former reached 7.4 million people over nine days, and the latter reached 9.8 million people over eight days. The key metric for Instagram seems to be “Awareness,” as it boasts glowing ad recall increases for both brands. It’s early days, but the ads seem to be doing what Instagram wants them to do.
