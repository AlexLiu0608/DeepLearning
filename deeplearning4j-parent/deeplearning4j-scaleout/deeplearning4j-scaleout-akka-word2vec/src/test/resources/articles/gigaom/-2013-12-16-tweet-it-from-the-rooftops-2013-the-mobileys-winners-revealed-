Summary:
Apps that boost first-responder logistics, keep drivers eyes on the road and expand childhood literacy took top honors in the first annual The Mobileys competition. Sponsored by Mobile Future, the awards spotlight early-stage wireless products that make a difference. Also debuting: the 2013 mobile year in review.
Last Wednesday in Washington, D.C., the room buzzed with entrepreneurs. Ubers were summoned, selfies tweeted and food instagrammed — all to celebrate game-changing wireless innovation.
We launched our 2013 Mobile Year in Review video and revealed the winners of Mobile Future’s new competition: The Mobileys . The awards recognize early-stage mobile innovations designed to make the world a better place. I was honored to serve as a judge, alongside leaders from the tech, mobile, venture capital and angel funding worlds.
The Mobileys  sought out startup incubators, tech communities and kitchen table coders who share our belief that the next great idea in mobile was already out there. Our hope? With a little recognition (and prize money), The Mobileys could help propel wireless innovators seeking to make a difference.
The Mobileys 2013 winners:
First place. Developed by volunteer firefighters, Page-Out’s  networked mobile applications allow first responders to update their availability with the touch of a button.
Second place.  HeadsUP!  is a transparent windshield display that integrates with smartphones, keeping drivers eyes on the road and hands on the wheel.
Third place.  Learn with Homer  helps young children learn to read. The mobile app includes a phonics program, illustrated stories, science field trips and art tools.
People’s choice.  INRFood allows consumers to scan bar codes of 300,000 grocery store items and instantly analyze nutrition facts and ingredients.
Now the fun part: watching our winners put the additional capital to work.
