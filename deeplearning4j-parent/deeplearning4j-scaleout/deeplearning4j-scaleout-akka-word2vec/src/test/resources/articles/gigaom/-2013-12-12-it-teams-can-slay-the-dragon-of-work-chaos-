Summary:
System upgrades, shifting priorities and plenty of drive-by work requests: It’s just another day at the office for IT. But some IT leaders have learned to leverage a few best practices to get more visibility, more control and ultimately slay the dragon of work chaos.
You know how chaotic work can be.
From the never-ending rush of support requests to massive software implementations to ever-changing priorities, IT leaders face a daily struggle to get their arms around all of those disconnected activities. It’s what we call the dragon of work chaos — and it can leave you seriously burned out.
To slay the dragon, most organizations turn to a grab bag of disconnected software tools — from spreadsheets to shared drives — or they simply throw more people at it. But more tools (or people) that don’t talk to one another only complicate the visibility challenges IT leaders already face: Who’s working on what? Are they working on the right things? And how much is it costing me?

The sources of work chaos
The high cost of a disconnected approach to enterprise work
