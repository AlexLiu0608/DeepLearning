Pebble owners that havenâ€™t already updated their smartwatch firmware today have a nice surprise waiting for them. PebbleOS v.1.14 launched late on Thursday evening , adding a few new features and fixes. Among the more prominent additions is a customizable Do Not Disturb mode, which disables notifications moving from your smartphone to your watch. Overall control of notifications is improved as well and data coming from iOS devices will begin to appear quicker after the update. The firmware update is available both for iOS and Android users directly from the Pebble smartphone app.
