It’s that time of the year again: YouTube stars like Freddie Wong, Toby Turner, Daily Grace, Mystery Guitar Man, Tyler Ward and a number of others are coming together Thursday night at 6pm P.T. for the site’s second annual Tube-A-Thon , a telethon-style live event that aims to raise money for charity. Just like last year , the event is going to be hosted by What’s Trending’s Shira Lazar, but this time around, it’s live streamed from YouTube’s Los Angeles studio space, which has been home to a growing number of live events this year, including YouTube’s first music awards show.
