IBM was one of the first big U.S. tech firms to pay the price for the NSA scandal. Although nobody has ever proven a link between the company and the agency, IBM joined Cisco in seeing a sudden collapse in Chinese sales after the Snowden leaks. China is also investigating the company , along with Oracle and EMC. Now an IBM shareholder is suing the company , alleging that it concealed its NSA ties and the attendant risk to its Chinese market position, and that it lobbied Congress to let it share Chinese customers’ data with the NSA. The company said the allegations are “ludicrous and irresponsible.”
