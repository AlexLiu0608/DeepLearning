Summary:
The Wellograph watch is an attractive activity tracker, heart rate monitor and running companion that delivers infographic-based wellness information, but it’s a little pricey.
There are plenty of activity trackers out there, but so far they all look better suited to an afternoon at the gym than a night at a black tie event. Wellograph, Inc. is hoping to change that with the introduction of the Wellograph, a “premium wellness watch” that looks more like a classic timepiece than a futuristic activity tracker. It’s an attractive device, with a sapphire crystal display to complement it’s built-in heart rate monitor, but at more than $300, it’s also rather pricey.
The Wellograph is an activity tracker, heart rate monitor and running watch in one. Design-wise, it looks a lot like the Sony Smart Watch 2  – a somewhat boxy display attached to a watch band. It looks a little chunky in the press renders, but it’s also far less obtrusive than most competing activity trackers. The watch automatically displays relevant information based on detected activity through a simple infographic interface. I haven’t seen the watch in person, but this CES preview video gives you an idea of what the interface looks like:
It’s quite attractive, with a very iOS 7-feel to it. The watch doesn’t require that you have a smartphone in order to display your activity information, though it will work via Bluetooth 4.0 with companion apps for iOS and Android devices. There’s no desktop site to view your activity, though, like Fitbit offers . Still, I quite like the look of the infographic-based interface, though it appears to be a little light on detailed information. The companion app should give you a closer look for deeper data analysis. The watch itself can store up to four months of your most recent acitivies.
The Wellograph is able to tell when you’re resting and when you’re working out, thanks to an integrated heart-rate sensor. It’s always sensing, and will automatically display continuous pulse readings during workouts. It also keeps track of your speed, pace and distance travelled.  It then takes this data and summarizes it in daily and weekly views.
The Wellograph should last for up to two weeks on a single charge, which is pretty impressive given its always-on display. I wonder if that’ll actually pan out, given that the Pebble smartwatch lasts for 5-7 days and the Qualcomm Toq lasts for a week. And the build of the watch – sapphire crystal, stainless steel and aluminum – is quite fetching, though it makes for a rather lofty price tag. A Wellograph spokesman told me to expect the watch for around $330 when it starts shipping in April 2014.
