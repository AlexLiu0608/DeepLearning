Well, it looks like Winamp won’t die after all: AOL will sell the pioneering music service along with server program Shoutcast to Belgian radio aggregate service Radionomy , according to TechCrunch . The details of the deal are not final, but TechCrunch says that the specifics should surface tomorrow. It seems like Radionomy’s DIY audio philosophy jives well with both Winamp and ShoutCast, especially as both have supported many homegrown radio stations over the years. However, whether Winamp will exist as a standalone product remains to be seen — Radionomy might benefit deeply from integrating the service directly into its current offerings.
