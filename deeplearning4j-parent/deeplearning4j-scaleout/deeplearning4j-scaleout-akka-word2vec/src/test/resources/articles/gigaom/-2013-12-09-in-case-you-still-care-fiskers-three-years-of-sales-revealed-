Summary:
In 2012 beleaguered Fisker actually had $170 million in income from sales of its electric cars. That makes the fall of Fisker just that more painful.
Electric car startup Fisker Automotive officially declared bankruptcy last month , many months after it was expected. Info is trickling out of those bankruptcy filings, like a list of high profile creditors , and in the last few days one filing has revealed Fisker’s annual sales (which the filing lists as “income” but looks like sales) for the years 2011, 2012, and 2013.
In 2012 Fisker actually took in $170 million selling its Fisker Karma electric sports car — roughly speaking that’s about 1,700 Karma cars. In total for the three years Fisker took in just over $200 million, which is the equivalent of the about 2,000 cars that it had reportedly sold. Back in late 2012, Dan Primack reported Fisker’s revenue had neared $200 million.
If Fisker was able to keep sales like that going, it could have had a better chance of surviving.
Alas, in 2013 Fisker only took in $8.6 million. You can see the inverted V of sadness in the bar chart below.
