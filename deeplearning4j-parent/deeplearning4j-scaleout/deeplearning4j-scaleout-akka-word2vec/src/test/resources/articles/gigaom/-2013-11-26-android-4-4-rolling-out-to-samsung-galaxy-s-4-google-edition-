In tandem with Monday’s rollout of KitKat for the HTC One Google Play edition , Samsung’s Galaxy S 4 Play edition is also getting the software. Google shared the news late Monday evening on its Android Google+ page . With Android 4.4 being the largest upgrade since the sale of Google Play edition phones, the quick release of the software shows a sort of “pecking order” for Android upgrades. Obviously the Nexus phones, which aren’t carrier controlled, get the software first, quickly followed by the Google Play phones, which are largely a pure Android experience. One notable exception is Google’s own Motorola phones; Android updates for the Moto X began last week .
