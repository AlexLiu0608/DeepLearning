In an interview with a local Seattle news station, Nintendo of America CEO Reggie Fils-Aime slid in a very interesting tidbit: the company is considering “little experiences” to bring to iOS.
“It’s largely going to be much more marketing activity-oriented, but we’ve done little things where there’s some element of gameplay – a movement, a shaking, something like that,” Fils-Aime told KING 5 News in Seattle earlier this week.
While it’s certainly not the full-on port of Mario titles that nostalgic Nintendo fans hope for, the decision to bring Nintendo to Apple’s mobile devices could be a lucrative one. The closest a Nintendo property has come to iOS was a spinoff of popular series  Professor Layton , entitled  Layton Brothers: Mystery Room . The game differed from traditional gameplay known for the series, but developers Level 5 managed to create an interesting game that stands well alone in its own right. It’s hard to tell from Fils-Aime’s vague answers whether or not a similar companion game could be on the table in these “experiences.”
At this point, though, it’s just a flirtation. The company made no mention of any forthcoming projects in its Nintendo Direct presentation, although it’s easy to see where some of its future projects could find a home on mobile. One notable service is  Pokemon Bank/Pokemon Transporter , a subscription service for the 3DS and online that allows Pokemon fans to store up to 3,000 pokemon and transfer them from older games into the latest title, Pokemon X/Y. It’s easy to see how that utility can be quickly and usefully ported to iOS, allowing Pokemon fans to peek in on their favorite characters throughout the day.
It’s unlikely that we’ll see Nintendo embrace iOS or mobile in general anytime soon, but Fils-Aime’s open-minded approach to experimenting with the platform could bring some great attention to the company.
