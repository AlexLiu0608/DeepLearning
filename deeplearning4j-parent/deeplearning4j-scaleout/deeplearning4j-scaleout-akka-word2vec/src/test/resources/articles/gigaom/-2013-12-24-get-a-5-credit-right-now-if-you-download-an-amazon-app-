Amazon is giving Android users a $5 credit in return for downloading any app — even a free one.
Do you own an Android device or know someone who’s getting one for Christmas? From today through December 28, Amazon is handing out $5 credits for app store goodies.
To get the $5, users have to download any Amazon app — even a free one. They will then receive a credit to spend on games, apps and other such things.
If you don’t have the app store installed, Amazon has instructions on how to do that here . The company adds that people who already have the app store need to make sure they have latest version installed.
Amazon is also offering “free apps of the day,” starting with something called Piano Master Christmas Special with Angry Birds Star Wars II reportedly on offer for tomorrow.
Apple users, meanwhile, can check out the “ 12 Days of Digital Gifts ” campaign that starts on December 26.
