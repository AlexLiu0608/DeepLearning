Summary:
On this week’s podcast: Is the Xbox One worth it as a media center? And why is Apple building a big solar farm in North Carolina?
The wait is over and the world can once again bask in the cool blue glow of next-generation consoles, as both the Sony Playstation 4 and Microsoft’s Xbox One were officially released. On this week’s podcast we talk about the Xbox One as a media device, especially in the wake of much cheaper (and admittedly less beefier) streaming devices like the Chromecast, which just got HBO GO. Then we shift gears to talk about a big solar farm Apple built and the heat Tesal is taking after a few fires broke out in its Model S car.
