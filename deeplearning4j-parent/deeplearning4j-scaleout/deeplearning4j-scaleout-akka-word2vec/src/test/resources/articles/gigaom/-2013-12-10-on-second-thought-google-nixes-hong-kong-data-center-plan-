Summary:
Google will expand data centers in Taiwan and Singapore instead of adding a facility so close to mainland China, even under Hong Kong’s special rules.

There will be no Google data center in Hong Kong for the foreseeable future and the company will instead expand existing facilities in Singapore and Taiwan, according to the  Wall Street Journal .
A Google spokesperson attributed the decision to the difficulty and expense of putting such a large facility in that crowded and space-constrained city. But, given U.S. concerns over Chinese censorship,  and more recent tensions between China and the U.S. over Edward Snowden’s disclosures of NSA snooping , there might be more than real estate prices at play here.
Google announced plans to put a $300 million data center in Hong Kong two years ago and said it would be operational within 1 to 2 years. It appears that this is the data center that is being scrapped.
Here’s a map of Google’s data centers around the world:
