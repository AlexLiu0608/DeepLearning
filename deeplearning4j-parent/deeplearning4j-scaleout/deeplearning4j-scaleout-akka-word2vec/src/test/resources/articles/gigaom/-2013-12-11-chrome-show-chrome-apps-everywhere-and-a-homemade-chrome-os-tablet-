Summary:
A video shows off the benefits of cross-platform, multi-device Chrome Apps, but will developers bite? We also learned a bit from our Chrome OS tablet experiment and find a must-have Chrome extension for folks that open dozens of tabs in Chrome.
﻿﻿﻿Want to try a Chrome OS tablet of sorts? It will require a new Windows 8 slate or 2-in-1 and unfortunately, the experience is lacking. However, we learn a few things from the experience worth sharing, one of which being Microsoft’s Surface Pro 2 leaves the Pixel in its dust! Chromecast has nearly a dozen new apps and our extension of the week is helpful for the power users out there. If you have more than 30 tabs open in Chrome at one time, you qualify!
