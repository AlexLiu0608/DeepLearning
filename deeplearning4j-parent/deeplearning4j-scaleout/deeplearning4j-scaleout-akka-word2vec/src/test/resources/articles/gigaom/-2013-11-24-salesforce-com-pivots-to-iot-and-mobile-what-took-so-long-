At Dreamforce last week, Salesforce.com threw in the towel on its “social enterprise” push  and CEO Marc Benioff trotted out a new marketing spiel around the Internet of Things and mobility . As an example, he talked about his electric toothbrush that will update his dentist with his oral hygiene habits. Pushing these hot buttons is not a bad move for a company that’s not exactly the most mobile-savvy vendor around. Salesforce.com touted alliances with the likes of Dropbox and Evernote, and will sell their applications via AppExchange. But the whole thing also feels a bit like putting lipstick on a chicken — an attempt to assume mobile cred long after it should have embraced mobile devices better than it has.
Salesforce.com also tried to erase confusion around its dual Force.com and Heroku PaaS strategy. How?  By launching Heroku1 , a new version of Heroku targeting the Salesforce.com ecosystem. Yeah, I was confused too.  But, the plan is to push Apex-centric Force.com for internal applications while Heroku1 is for customer facing apps, Heroku CEO Tod Nielsen said last week. That makes some sense. But, personal opinion: Force.com fades away in a few years.
Also not crystal clear is exactly how integrated the ExactTarget marketing technology acquired in June  is. Not very, is the theory, although it morphed ExactTarget into the ExactTarget Marketing Cloud . Magic!
Salesforce.com also cordoned off some of its infrastructure into an HP converged hardware-based cloud reserved for the biggest of big customers. This helps Salesforce.com tweak Oracle and also highlights the sort of weirdo industry collaborations that usually don’t amount to a hill of beans as far as customers are concerned. All that vendor mutual back scratching is mostly annoying.
Structure Show redux — All about PaaS
Heroku1 was just one of the PaaS stories breaking last week. CenturyLink bought Tier 3 and made it the basis of CenturyLink Cloud and Apprenda, the private PaaS for Java and .Net applications got $16 million in fresh dough . So there was a lot to talk about on last week’s Structure Show. If you miseed it, check out Apprenda CEO Sinclair Schuller, who zigs where other PaaS players zag.
