Summary:
Every business cares about the performance of their web and mobile applications but few more than OpenTable. The online restaurant reservations service is constantly finding new ways to speed up its applications to get the edge on its biggest competitor: the phone.
Studies show that consumers are more impatient than ever when it comes to application performance. According to the New York Times , a subsecond difference in response time is enough to send a prospective customer to your competitor’s website. But what if your competitor is the phone? OpenTable  finds that performance is even more important when the frame of reference is the speed and reliability of a landline. Convincing millions of people to make their restaurant reservations online or on a mobile app instead of over the phone required OpenTable to build an application that was unsurpassed both in user experience and in performance.
Watch the interview  with OpenTable’s Performance Lead, Alan Novitskiy, to find out how OpenTable keeps its end users choosing apps over phones with application performance management (APM) .
