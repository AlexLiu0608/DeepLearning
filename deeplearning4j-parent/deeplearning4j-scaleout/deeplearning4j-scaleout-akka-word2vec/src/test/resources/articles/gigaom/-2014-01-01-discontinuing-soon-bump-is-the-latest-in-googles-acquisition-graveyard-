Summary:
After getting acquired by Google in September, former high-flying app Bump has announced its shutdown at the end of the month.
Bump , the mobile app that gained traction nearly four years ago for its “magical” information transfer when two phones touched each other, seemed poised for greatness at the early dawn of the smartphone era. But the app struggled after its initial popularity, which eventually led creator Bump Technologies to accept an acquisition offer from Google in September. Like many other apps purchased by the search giant, Bump and sister app Flock will join the Google acquisition graveyard at the end of the month.
“We are now deeply focused on our new projects within Google, and we’ve decided to discontinue Bump and Flock,” David Lieb, Bump Technologies co-founder and CEO said on the company’s blog . “On January 31, 2014, Bump and Flock will be removed from the App Store and Google Play. After this date, neither app will work, and all user data will be deleted.”
In its years of acquisition, Google has left quite the trail of dead apps in its wake — Bump is just the latest in line. Celebrity communication app Wavii  also promptly closed its product after the company announced its acquisition deal with Google in April, just one countless other examples. While app closures are typical after Google subsumes the talent and technologies of the startups it acquires, it’s hard to feel good as a user when a popular app abruptly shutters its doors.
Despite both Bump and Wavii’s shutdowns, two of Google’s bigger acquisitions this year still support their original products: Gesture-control software Flutter, acquired in October, still supports its Mac version (although rumors have bubbled that newer versions and products have been waylaid), and high-profile real-time maps app Waze, which Google acquired in June for more than $1 billion , still regularly receives updates and support. But it’s likely that, in time, both of these services will be absorbed completely into Google, leaving more apps in the graveyard.
