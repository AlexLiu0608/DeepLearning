Mocana, a company that provides security for enterprise computing and is branching out into securing connected devices, has scored a $15 million round of funding led by GE Ventures . Existing investors Shasta Ventures, Southern Cross Venture Partners, Symantec and Trident Capital also participated in the round. Getting GE as a strategic investors is a coup for the company as GE is heavily investing in the internet of things on the corporate side. Mocanaâ€™s cryptography engines are in five of the top seven Android handset makers and inside devices from Panasonic and Honeywell.
