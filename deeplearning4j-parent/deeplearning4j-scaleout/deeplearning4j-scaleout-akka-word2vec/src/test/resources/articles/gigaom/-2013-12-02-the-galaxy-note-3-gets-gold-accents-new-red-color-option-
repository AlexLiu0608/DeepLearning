Silver not quite doing it for you? If you require your phablets to bring that extra bit of pizzazz, Samsung has good news for you. The company on Monday  announced that the Galaxy Note 3 will soon be available in a new “rose gold” finish.
The rose gold option will be available on the black and white versions of the phone. Instead of silver accents on the device – such as the band around the middle, the logo on the back and the outline around the home button – all of these details will be gold. I’m not a huge fan of gold, but the press photos look relatively tasteful.
In addition to this, Samsung is also planning to offer a brand new “merlot red” color option. This phone features red for the front and back panels, with silver details everywhere else. Aside from the new colors, these are still the same exact Galaxy Note 3 smartphones, with the same faux-leather back panels.
The phones are launching later this month, but you probably won’t be able to get them in time for the holidays. The new colors will be coming first to China, then to other areas according to “each market’s preference.”
