Summary:
Thanks to a DOS emulator written for Chrome, I’m getting my game on while offline — old school style! Tune in to our podcast to hear what makes the magic happen along with Chrome news from the week.
Each week we recommend either a Chrome app or extension on our Chrome Show podcast and this week harkens back to well before Chrome . And long before Google for that matter. DOSBox is an emulator for DOS that hit the scene back in 2002 and it’s available for Chrome in the form of an offline Chrome app . With some tweaking and research, I’ve actually got DOSBox running Zork , a text-based adventure game from 1977.
We briefly discuss DOSBox for Chrome as well as plenty of other Chrome news from the past week including Dell’s entry into the Chromebook market, the newest Google Sheets — which also runs offline — and Google’s Dart, a potential replacement for JavaScript. Tune in below or download the podcast right here to catch all the commentary.
