The PlayStation 4 has arrived: Within just 24 hours of its release in the U.S. and Canada only, the console already sold more than 1 million units, according to Sony . To put that in perspective, Nintendo’s latest console, the Wii U, has only sold 3.91 million units in its year-long lifetime. It’s unclear whether the sales count the company’s exclusive Day One preorders (which sold out over the summer), but Sony considers it a major win and, according to the AP , has set its sights on 5 million units sold by the end of March. Your move, Microsoft.
