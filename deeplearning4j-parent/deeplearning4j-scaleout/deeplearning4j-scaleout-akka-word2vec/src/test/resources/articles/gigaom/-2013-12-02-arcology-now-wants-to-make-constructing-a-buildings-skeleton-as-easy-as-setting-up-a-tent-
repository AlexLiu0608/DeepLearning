Summary:
The startup’s software generates the best set of steel rods to quickly and affordably put together organic-feeling structures.
Want a shed shaped like a castle crossed with an igloo? Architecture startup Arcology Now wants to make ordering it and setting it up easy enough for anyone via a software program that automatically generates the best design and instructions for assembly.
Buildings are made entirely out of steel rods that can be bolted together. Each rod is stamped with a code. Once builders learn what each code means, they can construct the entire structure without any further instructions.
The software, Universal Constructor, generates the ideal set of rods to manufacture any shape or size of a building. It also automatically calculates cost.
The original design for the building can be sourced either from a self-made model or from a 3D scan of a physical space. You can scan your backyard or send a quadcopter equipped with a camera into the air to scan an existing building or other large structure.
The resulting shapes are meant to feel organic. Arcology Now likens the process to “a techno version of a barn raising.”
Right now, Arcology Now’s system only creates the steel skeleton for a building. The company also makes fabric covers. In the future, the company plans to enclose its buildings with shrink wrap, foam and stucco and add plumbing, windows, floors doors and electrical wiring. Its creators say there is no limit to the size of building they create. The system could even be used to construct entire cities . Or it can be used to create greenhouses with a removable layer of soap bubble insulation .
Arcology Now is now selling two pre-designed structures via Kickstarter  for $2,000 or $3,000 a piece. If it hits its funding goal, it will display the technology at the MicroDwell architecture competition next year.
