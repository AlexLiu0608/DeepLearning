Researchers from the National University of Singapore and the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia have developed a new method of storing data on magnetoresistive random attached memory, or MRAM, chips that they claim can store data for at least 20 years . Some believe MRAM has promise in future consumer devices and in embedded systems because it’s faster, denser and longer-lasting than traditional DRAM and flash memory. However, it’s not exactly clear how revolutionary the researchers’ work is: An Arizona-based company called Everspin already produces MRAM technology it claims can last more than 20 years.
