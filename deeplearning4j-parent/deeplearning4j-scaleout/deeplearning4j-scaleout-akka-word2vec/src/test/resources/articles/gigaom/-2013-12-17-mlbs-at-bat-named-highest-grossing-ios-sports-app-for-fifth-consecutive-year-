It looks like MLB.com has hit a home run once again with its At Bat app. The iOS app on Tuesday was named the highest-grossing sports app by Apple for the fifth consecutive year in its annual Best of iTunes rankings. Itâ€™s also the only sports app to place among the top 100 highest-grossing applications for both the iPhone and iPad, placing 19th and 37th, respectively. The app was downloaded more than 10 million times in 2013, with 60 percent of subscribers accessing its premium features daily. The app is free to download and use, though premium features cost $2.99 per month.
