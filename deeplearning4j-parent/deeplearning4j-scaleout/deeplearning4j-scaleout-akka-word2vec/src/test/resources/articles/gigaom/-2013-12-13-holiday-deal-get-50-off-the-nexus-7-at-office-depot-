This holiday season, it seems that if you try you really hard, you don’t have to pay full retail price for almost anything. This week has brought us good deals on tablets from Amazon and Apple , and now you can get quite a nice price on this year’s Nexus 7 as well. Office Depot is offering the 16GB black tablet for $50 off , bringing the price to $179.99.
That’s a great price for a solid tablet, putting it right in line with the 16GB Kindle Fire HD (which itself is currently on sale for for $159 ). Of course, with the Nexus 7 you get Google’s latest software, as well as full, unfettered access to the Google Play app store and all of Google apps and services.
And if 16GB isn’t enough for you, Office Depot is also serving up $40 off the 32GB Nexus 7, which brings it down to $229.99. These prices are good through December 21. Not bad if you were already planning to pick up a tablet as part of your holiday shopping.
