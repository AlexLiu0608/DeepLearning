Ingress, created by Google’s Niantic Labs, is hard to describe: the real-time, location-based mobile Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) game also draws in features from the Alternate Reality Game (ARG) genre to keep users enthralled in a kind of global war, and its beta game culminated in a worldwide party that took place in both San Francisco and Buenos Aires. Now, with that chapter finished, Ingress has exited beta and is now available for free on Google Play . The app already has more than 1 million downloads and boasts players across the globe — just be prepared to lose some serious battery life.
