Even with more powerful phones out on the market, I still consider the Moto X to be among the best Android phones you can buy today . But you don’t want to buy one today; if you can wait until Monday, you’ll save $150 . Motorola is holding a special deal on all no-contract Moto X handsets and that includes custom Moto Maker versions and the unlocked Developer Editions. A 16 GB model will cost $349 while $399 will get you a 32 GB version. According to Motorola’s John Rinaldi, the sale starts at 8am on Monday and supply will be limited .
