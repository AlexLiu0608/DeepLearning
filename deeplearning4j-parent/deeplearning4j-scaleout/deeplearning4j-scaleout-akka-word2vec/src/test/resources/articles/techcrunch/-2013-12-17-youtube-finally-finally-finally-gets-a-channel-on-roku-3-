Mark this up as one of those things that we’ve been waiting for forever and had to happen at some point: YouTube announced today that it’s launched a channel on Roku streaming devices . Well, one Roku streaming device at least. The new YouTube app is available on Roku 3 devices in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and Republic of Ireland. And it provides fun stuff like HD streaming and the ability to control the YouTube app with your mobile phone.
