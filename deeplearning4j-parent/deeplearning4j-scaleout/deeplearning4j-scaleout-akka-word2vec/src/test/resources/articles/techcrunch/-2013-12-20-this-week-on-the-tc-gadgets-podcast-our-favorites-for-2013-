ChallengePost Will Soon Support Software Innovation On An Ongoing Basis Outside Of Contests
It’s the most reflective and introspective time of the year, so this week on the TechCrunch Gadgets Podcast we take a look back at the year that was and offer up our favorite gadgets.
John likes a lot of stuff, including the treadmill desk that has become a permanent fixture on the Gadgets cast, and some more broadly transformative gadgets, too. Predictably, I like Apple stuff, and also predictably, Matt Burns likes some kind of reciprocating saw or tool or whatever.
Some of the devices that come to mind can be found in our team gift guide , or on one of the other various gift guides we’ve been gifting you all season long.
So have a listen to this week’s episode of the TechCrunch John Biggs Treadmill Deskcast, featuring John Biggs in the title role, Darrell Etherington , and Matt Burns .
We invite you to enjoy our weekly podcasts every Friday at 3 p.m. Eastern and noon Pacific. And feel free to check out the TechCrunch Gadgets Flipboard magazine right here .
