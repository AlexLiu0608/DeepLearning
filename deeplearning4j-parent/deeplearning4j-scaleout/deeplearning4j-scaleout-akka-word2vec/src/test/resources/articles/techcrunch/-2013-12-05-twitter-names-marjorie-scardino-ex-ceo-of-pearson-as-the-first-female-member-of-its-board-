Twitter has announced the appointment of its first female board member, Marjorie Scardino, the former CEO of media company Pearson. The appointment is effective immediately. She’s also joining the audit committee, where she replaces David Rosenblatt.
“There couldn’t be a more exciting time in Twitter’s history to join!” Scardino tweeted enthusiastically.
Scardino is a smart choice: via her Pearson background, she has deep connections into the media industry, as well as into Europe. The media industry is a key partner for Twitter as the company builds out its revenue-generating business with advertising and coordinated information dissemination; and it has also pinpointed international growth — that is, outside the U.S. — as a key aim going forward.
The move puts to rest a long-running debate (and controversy ) around Twitter’s complete lack of female board members.
It didn’t help that when the issue came up earlier this year, CEO Dick Costolo apparently seemed to brush it off ( on Twitter , of course).
Since then, though, it feels like the company has been trying to make amends. In addition to the almost immediate murmurs that arose in the wake of Costolo’s comments that a woman was on the way (!), there have been other moves to further Twitter’s position as a supporter of women at its company, and in tech in general.
Case in point: today happens to be the first day for ChimeHack , a three-day hackathon and event in San Francisco being produced by Chime for Change, Women Who Code, and Twitter. It’s coordinated to coincide with the TEDWomen 2013 event also in the city. From what we understand, it’s one of the first events that Twitter is letting an outside organization host in its space. Costolo is speaking on Saturday as part of it.
Twitter points out that Scardino’s past experience also included a role on the board of mobile handset maker Nokia between 2001 and 2013. This, too, is a key detail and asset that will serve well at Twitter, which has built up a huge mobile business that today generates 65% of its advertising revenues .
Mr. Rosenblatt will continue to serve on the compensation committee of the Board and the nominating and corporate governance committee of the Board.
