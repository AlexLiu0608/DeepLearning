With $5.3M In Funding, Entitle Launches E-Book Service Emphasizing Ownership And Big Titles
Google Ventures is releasing its year-end data for 2013, showing that the firm made 75 new investments and saw 9 exits for the year. In total, GV has backed 225 companies since its founding four years ago.
One of this new investments included one of the hottest VC deals of the year, Google backed disruptive transportation startup Uber with $258 million, along with TPG.
IPOs included RetailMeNot, Silver Spring Networks and Foundation Medicine. Among the acquisitions in the firm: Parse (Facebook), Astrid (Yahoo), Makani Power (Google), and others. In its year in review, the firm reveals that new investment AngelList has helped startups raise $125 million in funding in 2013.
Additionally, the firm revealed a number of stats related to its design and research sprints, and its recruiting program, this year
The firm also added partner talent to its roster this year, including bringing on former CrunchFund partner (and my former colleague) MG Siegler to its investment team as a general partner and promoting Andy Wheeler and Blake Byers, to general partners. GV also added two new investment partners, Shanna Tellerman and Dave Munichiello, to its ranks.
As it adds more talent, GV also had more money to spend this year. GV updated its fund size to $300 million this year, from $200 million. Many have criticized the firm for not being in some of the blockbuster deals in the past few years, including Twitter, Pinterest and others, but the Uber and Nest investments have changed this. General Partner David Krane tells us that the firm now has $1.2 billion under management, and will be receiving another $300 million in funding from its sole limited partner, Google, in January.
Disclosure: Google Ventures is an investor in my husband’s startup, which is currently in stealth.
