Marketing Startup Shift Raises $6M For European Expansion
Today, Viber is launching a new feature called Viber Out to its entire user base.
See, Viber Out lets Viber users make calls to people who don’t have the Viber app, effectively mimicking a Skype Out feature by charging a low per-minute rate to mobile or landline numbers.
According to Viber, the prices are generally lower than Skype.
About a month ago, Viber prematurely launched Viber Out to help Typhoon Haiyan victims in the Philippines connect with their loved ones.
To use Viber Out, just visit the “More” tab, and choose Viber Out. From there, you’ll be able to purchase Viber Out credit. No update is necessary to access the new feature.
Viber Out is available across iOS, Android and Desktop, with a Windows Phone version coming soon.
Additionally, Viber is including even more stickers to the revenue-generating Sticker Market, launched about a month ago .
As it stands now, Viber stickers and Viber Out represent the entirety of Viber’s business model, but CEO Talmon Marco promises more sources of revenue in the future.
“Profitability is certainly something on our roadmap, but we currently plan to invest more in the business,” said Marco.
