Boxbee Launches A Sharing Library To Spark Peer-To-Peer Lending Of Unused Goods
If you’re looking for a little background on bitcoin in China – and speak Chinese – this video from our TechCrunch event in Shanghai last month may be of interest. Featuring BTCChina CEO Bobby Lee as well as bitcoin luminaries Xu Mingxing, Celso Pitta, Wang How, and Mark Mai. During the time I was there I saw a lot of excitement in regards to bitcoin but many Chinese saw it as just another fad.
Not surprisingly the panel was quite bullish on the currency and many of them recommended the viewers buy bitcoin, touting like infomercial pitch men. It’s fun viewing but, without the benefit of the live translation it will probably be useless to those who haven’t brushed up on their Chinese.
