Leaked Facebook Video Ad Pitch Deck Reveals Plans To Steal TV And YouTube Dollars
We’ve seen the global success of games like Angry Birds from Rovio, but while the latter has $42m in funding, ZeptoLab, who is sitting on 400 million downloads of its Cut the Rope game since its 2010 launch, has taken zero external financing.
That’s pretty amazing when you think about it, and this lack of funds is not holding it back from today releasing details about the sequel.
Cut the Rope 2: Om Nom’s Unexpected Adventure will be available from 19 December for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch for $0.99, with an Android version following early next year.
For the first time, players will be able to interact with main character Om Nom, with new challenges and gameplay elements across 120 levels. A new series of characters, Nommies, will help him collect candy on his way, Backdrops of a forest, junkyard, city park, sandy dam and underground all feature. Other versions get a new lift.
Check out the video below:
Cut the Rope: Time Travel gets the free Wild West and the future, accessible via three stars or in-game purchase. Cut the Rope: Holiday Gift hits Android for the first time and goes free on iOS. Cut the Rope: Experiments gets new game content. And a new level pack, Bamboo Chutes, comes out for iOS and Android in December.
Did we mention Om Nom gets new hats?
These games are creating powerful childrens’ brands. ZeptoLab already signed a deal with Burger King to bring their Om Nom character from Cut The Rope into kids’ meals this year.
Slovenia’s Outfit7, Australia’s Halfbrick and Finland’s Rovio, have all moved into merchandising over the past year. And the UK’s Moshi Monster has become a merchandising powerhouse, lately releasing an entire animated film.
