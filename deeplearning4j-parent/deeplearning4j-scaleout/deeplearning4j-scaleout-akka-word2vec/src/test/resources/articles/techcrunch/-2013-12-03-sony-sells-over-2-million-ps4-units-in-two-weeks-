Canon’s Long-Awaited EOS M2 Hopes To Improve On Canon’s First Mirrorless With Improved AF
After revealing that Sony had sold 250k PS4 units in the UK over opening weekend, the company has finally announced global sales over the past two weeks.
According to Sony’s PlayStation blog , the company sold 2.1 million units of the PlayStation 4 in the past two weeks, starting on November 15th on launch day. Sony also mentioned that, in the first 24 hours of availability, the company sold one million units.
Here’s what Sony had to say about it:
It’s an impressive and record-setting accomplishment for our company and for our industry, and we couldn’t have done it without you. I want to personally thank PlayStation fans, both old and new, for your vote of confidence. The best part: the PS4 journey has just begun. In addition to an incredible line-up of PS4 games from the best developers in the world, we will continue to introduce valuable new features and services to PS4 in the months and years ahead.
Microsoft also sold 1 million units of the Xbox One in the first 24 hours of availability, with more widespread availability but $100 higher price tag.
However, the Telegraph is reporting that the PS4 is winning the popularity contest, at least in the UK.
Still, many gamers are giving these new consoles some time in the market before making a decision, so while the battle may have been won by Sony, the war is far from over .
