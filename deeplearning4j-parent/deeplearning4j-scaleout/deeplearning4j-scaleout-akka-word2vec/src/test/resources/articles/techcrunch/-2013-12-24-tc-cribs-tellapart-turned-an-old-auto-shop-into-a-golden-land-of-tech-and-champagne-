TellApart, The Champagne-Soaked Startup HQ
There are a few extra special Christmas gifts that can’t be wrapped and don’t quite fit under the tree — love, family, happiness… and new episodes of Cribs , the TechCrunch TV show that takes you inside the doors of the tech industry’s hottest companies to see what day-to-day life is like for the people who work there!
In this special holiday-themed Cribs episode, we headed to TellApart , the customer data technology startup headquartered just 16 miles south of San Francisco in Burlingame, California.
TellApart is doing some gangbusters business — the company is profitable and just announced that its annual revenue runrate crossed $100 million — so it’s no surprise that its offices are pretty sweet. And who better to give a tour than Josh McFarland, TellApart’s founder and CEO who also led the entire project of designing its office, transforming an old auto shop into a gleaming modern startup HQ.
Check out the video embedded above, and I’d encourage you to watch until the end: TellApart has a pretty amazing ritual it observes for every big business milestone it has, and fortunately a filming of Cribs made the cut. I won’t spoil the surprise, but it involves a saber and a bottle of champagne, and it is a pretty festive thing to behold.
