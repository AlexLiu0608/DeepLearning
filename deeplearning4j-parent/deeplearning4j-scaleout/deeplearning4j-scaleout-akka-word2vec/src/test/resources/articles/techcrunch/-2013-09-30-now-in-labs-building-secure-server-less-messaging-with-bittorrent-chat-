I read the following in a CNET article:
“Eventually, the service is expected to work with other instant-messaging accounts … but for now it requires a BitTorrent account.”
This doesn’t make sense. Why should this type of communication require any type of account? it seems to defeat the whole purpose of anonymity.
I suggested a similar type of application in the bittorent developer general forum. The idea was to be similar to Sync which uses secrets, only that the secrets would be PKI-based (publib/private-key). No accounts should be necessary (or desirable) for this to work.
Is the article at CNET wrong, and they made assumptions? Or does the group working on Bittorrent Chat plan to require the use of accounts for communicating using the system?

Just create a handshake between user. Once the handshake connection is established between you and the contact (1 or more), messages/data will move between you and the contact, no middle man. If disconnected, your Mobile can check the last sequence, and proceed once connection restored.
Encrypted data will only stay at the source device/mobile only.
