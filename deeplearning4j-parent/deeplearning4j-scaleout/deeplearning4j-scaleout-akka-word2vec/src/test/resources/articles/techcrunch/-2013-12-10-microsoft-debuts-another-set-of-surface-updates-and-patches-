As 2013 wraps to an end, Microsoft released its final set of Patch Tuesday fixes, updating its Surface line of tablets at the same time.
According to Microsoft, the fixes include 11 bulletins, five of which are marked critical, solving 24 vulnerabilities. That’s quite the raft. Among the patched products are Windows, Office, Internet Explorer, and Exchange. So, more so than in some months, you want to get yourself up to date.
Security firm Qualys points out that two zero-day flaws amongst the mix only cause havoc if a company is still using Windows XP, which it estimates that about 15% of enterprises still are. Keep in mind that the end of Windows XP support is rapidly approaching. Qualys correctly wrote today that a company’s “security situation will then become very quickly unmaintainable” if it stays on XP after Microsoft removes support. Microsoft itself would like it very much if folks would stop using Windows XP.
The real meat out today is a set of Surface updates, however, which should bring quality of life improvements to owners of Microsoft’s line of tablets. As collated by Mary Jo Foley , here they are:
Surface Home Button Driver update to optimize available system memory
Surface Type Cover audio device driver update to enhance trackpad sounds for Type Cover 2
Fix for screen dimming during CPU intensive operations resolved
Decreased charge time for batteries resolved
Two-finger trackpad use optimized
Update to support additional external displays
Skype video quality improved
