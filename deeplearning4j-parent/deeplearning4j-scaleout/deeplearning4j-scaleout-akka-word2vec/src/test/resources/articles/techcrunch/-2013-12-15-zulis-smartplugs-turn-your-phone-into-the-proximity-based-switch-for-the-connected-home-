Metail, The UK Virtual Fitting Room Startup, Raises Further £2.6M As It Stretches London’s Tech City
A recent Kickstarter project called the Zuli Smartplug makes each of your power outlets intelligent thanks to Bluetooth low-energy, along with remote control from a smartphone, proximity triggering and scheduling, too. It’s sort of like what you maybe have been hearing about with Apple’s iBeacons, where retail can sense a shopper’s specific location within a store and provide different content to their devices based on where they are, but for at-home use with your existing electrical appliances.
Zuli’s Smartplugs can detect when you walk into or out of a room, and trigger customized actions based on what you want them to do in either case. That means you could have your computer, desk lamp, space heater and more turn on when you enter your office, for instance, or have everything but the radio turn off when you leave home for the evening. The Zuli Smartplugs also work in tandem with one another, creating a Bluetooth mesh network to let them communicate with each other. A minimum of three outlets is required for accurate location tracking within a home, according to Zuli, but even without that the gadget can still be used to monitor your energy usage and manage smart scheduling and instant control of power outlets.
The Zuli has a lot in common with existing products like the Belkin WeMo Switch, but that product also requires a Motion accessory separately to use the location-based automation. Zuli’s option is also more cost effective through the Kickstarter campaign, as it offers a three-pack starter kit for $135, while Belkin’s WeMo outlets are $60 each, as are the motion kits separately.
