Redpoint’s Geoff Yang On What Makes A Successful Entrepreneur
In this week’s Ask A VC episode, Redpoint partner Geoff Yang joined us in the studio to talk about entrepreneurship, international investing and much more.
Yang, who has backed a number of tech giants and hot startups over the past two decades, talked about what makes a great entrepreneur. He’s said in the past that successful entrepreneurs see patterns and opportunity where others see chaos. He talked specifically in the interview about some of the founders he’s worked with who fall into that bucket.
Yang also talked about the firm’s investments in Asia and beyond. Check out the video above for more!
