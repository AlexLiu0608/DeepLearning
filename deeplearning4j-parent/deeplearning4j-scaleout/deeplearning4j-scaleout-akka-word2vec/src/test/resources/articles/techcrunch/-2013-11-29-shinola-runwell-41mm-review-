It’s definitely a retro affair, and the model I tested emphasizes that with a brass finish on the metal case. The lugs are similar to those that were once welded to pocket watches to make the first wristworn timepieces, and even the choice of typefaces for the Shinola logo and movement name harken back to a vaguely 30s or 40s-ish time period. All of which is to say, I like the look of the watch very much, but if your taste runs more modern you might not agree.
Another very nice aspect of the model I tested was the Horween leather strap (made in Florida), which has a couple of lines of contrast stitching near the lugs and matte brass hardware to match the case. It’s extremely comfortable, while also remaining durable and good-looking.
It’s not typically my thing to go in for quartz watches, even when the design language they use is right up my alley. But the Shinola features such a bold design that it earns a place next to something like a Uniform Wares in terms of esteem, meaning it’s unique enough that the price tag becomes less of an issue. At those prices, however, you’re still getting into the affordable range for great entry-level automatics, like the Defakto lineup or a Stowa Flieger, which means there’s going to be a lot of competition for the Shinola with any customer serious about watches. Still, it’s good-looking, works well and, marketing aside, it is assembled in Detroit by a company that employs more than a hundred Americans, so there’s plenty of reason to consider one as a gift for the watch appreciator in your circle.
