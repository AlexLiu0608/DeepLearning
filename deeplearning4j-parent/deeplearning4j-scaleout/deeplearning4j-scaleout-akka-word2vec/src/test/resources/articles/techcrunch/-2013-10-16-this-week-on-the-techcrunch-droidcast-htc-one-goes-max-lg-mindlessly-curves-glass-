LG is following Samsung’s example in providing a curved glass smartphone that makes no earthly sense , HTC is offering a fingerprint scanner that no one needs executed poorly , and Mad Catz is entering the crowded Android console space – for which there is no proven demand.
The Android world has gone mad this week, and me and your host Chris Velazco are just trying to put the pieces back together. Join us as we try to divine the twisted psyche of the people who created these unnatural devices.
We invite you to enjoy  weekly Android podcasts  every Wednesday (or Thursday this week) at 5:30 p.m. Eastern and 2:30 p.m. Pacific, in addition to our  weekly Gadgets podcast  at 3 p.m. Eastern and noon Pacific on Fridays. Subscribe to the  TechCrunch Droidcast in iTunes, too, if that’s your fancy .
