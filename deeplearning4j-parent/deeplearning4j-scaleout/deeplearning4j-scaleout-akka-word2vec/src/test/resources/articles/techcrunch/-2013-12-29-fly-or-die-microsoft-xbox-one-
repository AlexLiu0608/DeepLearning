Xbox One | Fly or Die
Microsoft’s Xbox One is off to a great start, launching with cable TV control, bumped up graphics, and an all-new Kinect.
But is upgrading worth it?
Our own Greg Kumparak has said in his review that it’s a tough upgrade from the Xbox 360, after customers have grown accustomed to taking such huge technological leaps during earlier generational transitions. And John Biggs isn’t thrilled with the early titles available at launch.
Still, it’s hard not to be excited about the live TV control, and the speed with which you can switch between gameplay and television. If only the voice-control feature were a bit more reliable.
In the end, we recommend waiting a year or so for the $499 price to come down a bit, but eventually most gamers will want to make the transition.
