Google Destroys Rap Genius’ Search Rankings As Punishment For SEO Spam, But Resolution In Progress
Maybe it’s the ham and biscuit brunch talking, but here’s something we’ve never done: an open thread. To celebrate our new Facebook commenting system, I’d like you all to start sharing what you’d like to give the world this Christmas. Is it your start-up? Is it a new hardware project? Is it a great idea? An event you’re planning? Share it here and let’s have a nice, free-for-all Festivus of self-promotion/happiness/good wishes. I’ll keep my eye on this thread and follow up with you folks in 2014.
Happy Festivus!
