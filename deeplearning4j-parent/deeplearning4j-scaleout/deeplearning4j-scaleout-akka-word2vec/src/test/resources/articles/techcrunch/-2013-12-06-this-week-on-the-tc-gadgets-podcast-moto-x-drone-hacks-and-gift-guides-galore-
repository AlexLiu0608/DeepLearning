Happy Friday, lovers.
Gift Guide season is upon us, which is why we spend a good chunk of this podcast discussing smart gifts to buy your friends and loved ones. But that didn’t stop us from chatting up the Cyber Monday drama over at Motorola during the Moto X promotion , or the SkyJack drone hack that turns one drone into the leader of an aerial army.
Listen in to all this and more on this week’s episode of the TC Gadgets Podcast , featuring John Biggs , Matt Burns , Jordan Crook , and Darrell Etherington .
Enjoy!
We invite you to enjoy our weekly podcasts every Friday at 3 p.m. Eastern and noon Pacific. And feel free to check out the TechCrunch Gadgets Flipboard magazine right here .
