Rentals Delivered By Drone Could Make Ownership Obsolete
The Chernin Group confirmed today that it has acquired a majority stake in anime video distribution company Crunchyroll . The deal was first reported by AllThingsD in October and gives Peter Chernin’s investment company one of the largest streaming sites out there, with viewers in more than 160 countries worldwide.
Like Hulu, which Chernin had sought to invest in earlier this year, Crunchyroll has both a free, ad-supported video offering, as well as a subscription video-on-demand offering for anime fans. It’s available online and on a wide range of devices, including phones, tablets, game consoles, and streaming video boxes like Apple TV and Roku.
In addition to video, Crunchyroll also provides e-commerce, news, and community features for viewers. With the investment by Chernin, the company is expected to dabble into new channels outside of its core anime vertical.
