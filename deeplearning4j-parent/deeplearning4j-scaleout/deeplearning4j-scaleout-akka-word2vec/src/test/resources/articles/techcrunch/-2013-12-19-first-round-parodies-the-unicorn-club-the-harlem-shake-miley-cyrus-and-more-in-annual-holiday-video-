CyanogenMod Quickly Raises Another $23 Million Led By Andreessen Horowitz
VCs may be clamoring to expand their online video and marketing content, but no firm will ever be able to beat First Round Capital’s annual holiday video.
This year’s video, which features the firm’s staff and partners as well as First Round’s portfolio, parodies Miley Cyrus’ ‘Wrecking Ball’ , The Harlem Shake, and more. In one of our favorite videos in the firm’s 6-year history of doing this, the clip prominently features the theme of the Unicorn Club, a thought piece about the traits and learnings behind billion-dollar-plus companies and their founders, written by Cowboy Ventures founder Aileen Lee on TechCrunch in November.
Other songs and viral videos included are Daft Punk’s Get Lucky, the Geico Hump Day Camel Commercial, and Macklemore ‘s “Thrift Shop.”
Along with having one of the more successful portfolios in the VC industry, First Round is known for its hilarious and amazing holiday videos , such as past riffs on Call Me Maybe and Gangnam Style , Rebecca Black’s Friday and Les Misérables .
Enjoy!
