Amazon Delivery Drones, Uber’s Revenue Leaks, and 23andMe’s FDA Troubles
December is officially here, and it’s a particularly cold weekend for much of the United States. Looking for a way to stay warm? I humbly suggest that you huddle around the cozy glow of your computer screen and watch a new episode of CrunchWeek , the show that brings a few TechCrunch writers together to chat about the most fascinating stories of the past seven days in tech.
In this week’s episode, Leena Rao, Ryan Lawler and I discuss Amazon’s much-buzzed-about experiments in making deliveries using unmanned flying drones , the leaked screenshot that showed just how much money Uber is raking in (it’s a lot), and 23andMe’s battles with the FDA over the marketing and sale of its genetic testing kits.
