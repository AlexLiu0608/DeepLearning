MaxStone Kickstarts A Remote iPhone Shutter For Digital Cameras That’s Also A Bluetooth Tracker
Worried that none of their recent commercials would take home that coveted “Worst Ad Of The Year” trophy, Samsung has swooped in with one hell of a last minute entry.
It’s like Samsung wanted to give us all a Christmas present. But instead of giving us socks, or candy, or a puppy, Samsung gave everyone a big ol’ box of cringe.
Like any masterpiece of cinema, the spot leaves the viewer with questions to consider post-viewing. Watch the commercial above, then join us below for some of our favorite bits:
0:15 – If a stranger asks “Want to see something cool?” on a ski lift, is the answer ever anything but “No”?
0:28 – Did he just kill someone? Pretty sure he just killed someone.
0:32 – Ey pree lady.
0:55 – “Check this out. I know I just met you literally 15 seconds ago, but I took 64 pictures of you.”
1:14 – Oh god why is he watching this video in a club who does that
1:51 – Why is she calling him? She JUST walked away from him. Seriously, she just walked out of frame less than 2 seconds ago. Maybe they’re both crazy.
2:12 – “Where’s this music coming from?” “From my phone, which I placed like 20 feet away for some reason”
2:20 – Jiggle fist pump.
