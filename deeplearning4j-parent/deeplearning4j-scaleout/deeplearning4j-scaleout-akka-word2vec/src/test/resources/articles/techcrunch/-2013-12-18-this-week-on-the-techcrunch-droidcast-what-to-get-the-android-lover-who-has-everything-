Google’s Location History Browser Is A Minute-By-Minute Map Of Your Life
After a whirlwind trip in Toronto, my co-host Darrell Etherington and I are back in our respective countries and ready to talk about what’s new with Android. But first, a heartrending disclaimer — we were not wearing festive sweaters while recording the show like the image would indicate, but we did get a little festive talking about Google’s new Play Edition devices, what’s new in the world of Google Glass, and our picks for last minute Android-centric gifts. That’s got to count for something right?
And as for next week? Christmas does indeed land on Droidcast day, and the two of us may just sneak away from our families to spend a few moments discussing what (if any) Android goodies were left under the tree for us. Why would we do that? Because we love you thiiiiiiiiiiis much.
We invite you to enjoy  weekly Android podcasts  every Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. Eastern and 2:30 p.m. Pacific (generally speaking), in addition to our  weekly Gadgets podcast  at 3 p.m. Eastern and noon Pacific on Fridays. Subscribe to the  TechCrunch Droidcast in iTunes, too, if that’s your fancy .
