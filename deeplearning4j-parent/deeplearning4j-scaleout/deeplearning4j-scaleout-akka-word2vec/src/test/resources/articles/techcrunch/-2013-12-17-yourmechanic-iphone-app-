Google Glass Gets ‘Wink To Shoot Picture’ Mode, Lock Screen, YouTube Uploading And Hangouts Chat
TechCrunch Disrupt winner YourMechanic just got a lot more mobile with an iPhone app that will help users to better diagnose repairs that are needed. The app will also send notifications to users as their car is being serviced and could even allow them to see pictures of jobs being done.
YourMechanic launched last year to provide an easy way for car owners to book appointments with mechanics that come to them. The idea was to create a marketplace of mechanics that would come to users and service their cars
But there was one problem: Most people recognized that their car had problems when they were in it. Then they had to go to a computer and relay the issue online and try to diagnose it from inside their home or office.
The new mobile app solves that problem, by giving users a way to report issues when they find out about them, and to find mechanics nearby. That’s especially helpful for diagnosing non-specific issues, like fluid leakage or strange noises emanating from the car that the user can better report on from a mobile phone than from a computer.
Even for those who are looking just to get routine maintenance done, the app simplifies things a bit. Users can get a list of available mechanics, including profiles and ratings, and schedule times directly from the app. They’ll also get push notifications letting them know when a certain job is done or get updates along the way.
Push notifications are also helpful for reminding users when it’s time to get scheduled maintenance done, since it knows when a mechanic last looked at an automobile.
For now, the YourMechanic app is only available on iPhone, though co-founder Abhas Art Agrawal says the company is working on an Android version. YourMechanic has raised $1.8 million from investors that include Y Combinator, SV Angel, Yuri Milner, Andreessen Horowitz, Lerer Ventures, Launch Capital, Jeff Clavier, CrunchFund (which is owned by TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington), Paige Craig, A-Grade Investments, Jawed Karim, Justin Waldron, Joshua Schachter, and Kevin Freedman.
