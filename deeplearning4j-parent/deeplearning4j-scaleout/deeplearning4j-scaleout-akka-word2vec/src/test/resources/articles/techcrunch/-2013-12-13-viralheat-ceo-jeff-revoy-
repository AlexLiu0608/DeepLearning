Obama’s NSA Task Force May Recommend Meaningful Changes
Viralheat is announcing that it has a new CEO: Jeff Revoy, whose recent roles include serving as former Chief Marketing and Product Officer at email marketing company iContact.
A company spokesperson suggested that it was time for a new CEO because Viralheat is shifting its focus from small and medium businesses to larger enterprises: “Jeff has a lot of experience helping companies like iContact transition into the Enterprise space and will help take Viralheat through its next phase of growth.”
They added that the previous CEO, co-founder Raj Kadam, will remain “100% active at the company,” working on sales and business development.
Revoy’s résumé includes multiple vice president roles at Yahoo, serving as chief revenue officer at ChooChee (which was, it seems, quietly acquired by T-Mobile, as we’d reported ), and the aforementioned position at iContact (which was acquired by Vocus for $169 million ).
Founded in 2009 and backed by mayfield Fund, Viralheat’s services include social media monitoring, analytics, publishing, sentiment analysis, and more, and it says it serves “thousands” of customers. In the press release announcing his hiring, Revoy praised Viralheat’s “easy-to-naviate monitoring and analytics tools that help large businesses succeed in a rapidly changing digital communications environment.”
