Gillmor Gang: Private Practices
The Gillmor Gang — Robert Scoble, Keith Teare, Kevin Marks, and Steve Gillmor — work off that stuffed feeling with a show devoted to the intersection between public and private messaging. What started with Twitter and continued with Facebook has now yielded a startup frenzy many mistake for a bubble. Instagram started the ball rolling, SnapChat doubled down on it, and many fear it will end badly and absorbed by the big players.
But just as the Yankees can’t buy a championship, neither will Facebook or even Google slow down the momentum of these private streams. What @scobleizer calls Snapchat’s brand promise may seem to be breakable only at the peril of the founders. I think something else is at work, built on the metadata that these self-destructing messages incentivize. As these services morph in their realtime metaloops, we’re seeing the future materialize in front of our mobile eyes.
