Deep Learning for Java
=====================================

Leverages matrix operations built on top of 

the BLAS linear algebra libraries for faster 

performance over your standard java libraries.

Includes the following algorithms:

DBN - Deep belief networks; restricted boltzmann machines stacked as layers
CDBN - Continuous Deep Belief Networks; contiuous layer at the front
RBM - Restricted Boltzmann Machines
CRBM - Continuous Restricted Boltzmann Machines
SdA- Stacked Denoising AutoEncoders
