Summary:
Config management expert Puppet Labs snags Microsoft finance veteran Bill Koefoed as its new chief financial officer
Puppet Labs  is naming Bill Koefoed, who was the top finance guy at Microsoft’s Skype Division, as its CFO. The news was to be announced Thursday but was picked up by AllThingsDigital  on Tuesday night.
Puppet Labs CEO Luke Kanies
Portland, Ore.-based Puppet Labs (see disclosure) is a major player in the booming devops field where its configuration management software — along with Opscode’s Chef – leads the leagues, although both face growing competition from upstarts like AnsibleWorks.  These companies hope to ease overall IT management whether that IT lives in a company’s data center or server room or off in some cloud somewhere.
Puppet Labs founder and CEO Luke Kanies told OregonLive that Koefoed brings new skills the company needs as it grows. In January, Puppet got  $30 million in funding from VMware  and put VMware executive VP  Raghu Raghuram  on the board.
With total investment of about $45 million, that VMware money caused some to wonder if Puppet’s vendor-agnostic stance towards configuration management was shifting, a contention that Kanies dismissed. Bringing on a former Microsoft exec might reassure folks on that front.
Disclosure: Puppet Labs is backed by True Ventures, a venture capital firm that is an investor in the parent company of this blog, Giga Omni Media. Om Malik, founder of Giga Omni Media, is also a venture partner at True.
