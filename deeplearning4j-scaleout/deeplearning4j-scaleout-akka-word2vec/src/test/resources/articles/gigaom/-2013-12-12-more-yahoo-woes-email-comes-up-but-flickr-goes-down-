Summary:
Yahoo’s having a rough week: after barely patching together its email services, Flickr went down for a portion of Thursday.
The wheels are coming off at Yahoo today, as its troubles hopped from one service to another. First, a days-long email outage sent users complaining on every available internet platform, and now Flickr ran into trouble as well, according to TechCrunch .
Users were outraged after an outage locked many out of their email accounts for days, but Yahoo managed to shakily patch things back up around yesterday evening. However, the fix wasn’t clean despite Marissa Mayer’s all-clear from her Tumblr. The company said at 11:15 p.m. PST:
Some users may still have trouble accessing their accounts but we are working through the night on this and will post again in the morning Pacific Time with the latest updates.
As of this writing, no further updates have been made.
But while putting out one fire, another began to blaze on Flickr. The photo-sharing site was down for an hour this afternoon, starting around 11 a.m. EST. Reports of trouble were not widespread, but users continued to have issues well into the afternoon.
Like its current email crisis, Yahoo has been decidedly mum about the whole thing. Flickr’s Twitter page reported no outages or issues of any kind affecting a large portion of users, and Yahoo has yet to directly comment about what happened.
Here’s hoping that Yahoo learns from this harsh week and understands that users need to be informed about issues and outages across all services. Outages may be an occasional fact of life, but a little user outreach can go a long way.
