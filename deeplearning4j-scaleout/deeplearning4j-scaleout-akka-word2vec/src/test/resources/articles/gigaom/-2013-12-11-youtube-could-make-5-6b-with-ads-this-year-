YouTube’s ad revenue is set to hit $5.6 billion this year, according to an eMarketer report relayed by the Financial Times . The same report estimates that the service’s net revenue after paying its partners is close to $2 billion, which would be significantly more than the $1.65 billion that Google paid for YouTube in 2006. YouTube now gets about 20 percent of all U.S. online video ad money.
