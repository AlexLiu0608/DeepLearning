When Apple posted its year in review on Tuesday, it did something it has never done before: award an education app the top prize. Duolingo, the translation app that was  recently updated with more gamified features , was named iPhone App of the Year — beating out VSCO Cam, Endless Alphabet, and other non-gaming apps for the top prize. A rep for the company indicates that this is the first education app that Apple has awarded with the honor, and that the 18-month-old app has more than 16 million users worldwide. The app is available for free on both iPhone and iPad.
