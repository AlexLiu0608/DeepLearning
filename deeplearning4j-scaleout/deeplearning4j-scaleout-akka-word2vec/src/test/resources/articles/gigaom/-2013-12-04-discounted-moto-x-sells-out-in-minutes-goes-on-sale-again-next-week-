After a Cyber Monday snafu , the Moto X went on sale again this morning at 9AM PT. But it appears that Motorola underestimated demand, as the allocated supply of discounted phones has already run out. The sale requires you to register with your name and email address at Motorola’s site to get a $150 discount code on an off-contract Moto X ordered through Moto Maker . But if you go there now, you’ll only see a message that says “We’ve sold all the phones we allotted for this promotion.” If you missed out you can try again on December 9, though. Same time, same place .
