The security of NFC is designed to be invisible, working behind the scenes so that you have a seamless and convenient experience without cumbersome security measures. To safeguard the user, the NFC infrastructure enabled by Gemalto brings security to the entirety of the NFC process.
In the quick tap of your mobile device to the NFC reader, there are many security steps involved some that have already occurred even before the information exchange takes place. To be able to do all of the many NFC use cases , your information needs to be securely stored on your mobile. But how does it get there? Inside your phone is a smart chip known as a secure element (SE), and it acts as a Fort Knox that can store your personal information and receive updates. Another piece of the security puzzle is what we refer to as a TSM, or trusted service manager, and it manages the NFC service applications by acting as a trusted intermediary.
