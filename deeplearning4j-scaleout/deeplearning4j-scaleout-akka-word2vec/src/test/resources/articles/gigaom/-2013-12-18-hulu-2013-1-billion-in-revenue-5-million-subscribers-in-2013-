Summary:
Hulu had a big 2013, with big increases in revenue and viewership.
Hulu released a blog post detailing its year-end review of performance in 2013, and it’s turned out to be a successful one for the media streaming company.
By the end of 2013, Hulu will reach $1 billion in revenue, up from $700 million in 2012. The company has also seen a surge in paying subscribers for Hulu Plus, shooting up from more than 3 million last year to 5 million by the end of this year.
While Hulu has been successful in working with streaming devices like Google’s  Chromecast , the company has also managed to forge stronger partnerships with next-generation gaming consoles like Xbox One and PlayStation 4 . It’s clearly serving a demand, as the company reports that more than half of its Hulu Plus users access content on streaming devices. And those users stayed with Hulu for long sessions — the company reports that users streamed more than 1 billion videos each quarter.
Hulu’s success comes at a time when video streaming is just hitting its stride . The company’s deals with networks as well as its production of original content means that cord-cutting and committing to streaming are becoming a more viable option than ever. But 2014 will be a test — especially as cable companies like Time Warner attempt to bring users back into cable’s fold.
