Summary:
As the holidays draw close, these twelve gift ideas will help accentuate the most often used features for any iPhone or iPad owner on your shopping list.
With Apple’s iPhone being the most sought after gift for teenagers followed by the iPad , and with more than 700 million iOS devices sold since their debut , you are bound to know someone on your Christmas list that would appreciate one of the following this holiday season. These twelve gift ideas help accentuate some of the most used features of Apple’s iPhone and iPad devices.
Monopod and an iPhone Camera Mount – As iPhones transition from being an everyday camera into the only camera that one owns, accessories that were once reserved for high-end cameras start to make sense to use with your iPhone. One such accessory is a camera mount and monopod. Monopods are much more portable than tripods and prove to be easier to use when taking video. The iStabilizer Monopod for $35 will make taking long videos at school plays and sporting events much easier to manage.
Remote Battery Chargers – The question isn’t whether your device will drain its battery, it’s when. As we all seem to be using battery-powered devices more and more, having a backup mobile charger is something that anyone would appreciate. Mophie has a series of Juice Pack Powerstations  ranging from $59 to $99 that can be used to recharge any USB powered device. Additionally there are the Juice Pack Air , Helium and Plus iPhone battery cases for $79, $99 and $119 respectively.
Adding GPS to a WiFI iPad – Wi-Fi only iPads do not have the same GPS capabilities of the cellular iPads . To add better GPS capabilities to such an iPad you can use the Bad Elf 2200 GPS Pro for $179. With it you can turn any Wi-Fi only iPad into a turn-by-turn navigation unit using a navigation app that allows you to download road maps ahead of time. In fact, the TomTom U.S.A. app for $35 and the  Magellan RoadMate North America  app for $45 come pre-loaded with all the maps you need at the time you purchase the app.
AirPlay and AirPrint Accessories – With AirPlay you can project audio, video or both to your home theater system. While the Apple TV for $99 comes with an HDMI port to connect to your HDTV, the Airport Express from Apple for $99 comes with an audio jack that can turn just about any amplifier or speaker system into an AirPlay audio solution. And if you would rather project the contents of your iOS device onto paper, consider the Epson Expression Home XP-410 Small-in-One Wireless Inkjet Printer for just $69. At that price it’s almost cheaper than the ink that comes with it .
Lego Brand iPhone Case – Adding a little fun to your iPhone could not be easier than with the Lego Belkin Brand iPhone 5 Case for just $39. You can create you own custom iPhone stand or even build a miniature theater setting. Using the smallest, flattest one-piece Legos, you can even add someone’s initials to the back. This could even be a fun way to wrap your old iPhone when turning it over to a younger member of your family this holiday season.
Twelve South Device Stands – While most of us seldom put our iDevices down, when we do we are looking for a way to do so in style. And the collection of stands that Twelve South produces for both the iPhone as well as the iPad are both functional and stylish. There is the stylish BookArch for $29 that looks great on a table or desk, and the Compass for $39 for travelers.  One stand in particular, the HighRise for iPhone and iPad Mini for $35, can be adjusted to work even if you have left your device in its case. Just about everything that Twelve South sells could be on any Apple lover’s wish list each year.
Portable Bluetooth Speaker – While AirPlay is great for extending your home theater around the house over Wi-Fi, a good portable set of speakers is sometimes nice to have around. And if you already have a set of speakers that you like, consider getting the iKross Bluetooth Stereo Adapter for $25 which can turn any speaker into a Bluetooth speaker. For something a little more portable, the JBL Micro Wireless Speaker for $59 is a great travel companion with a big sound.
Inline Headphone Amplifier – Finding a good set of headphones that both sound and feel great is a personal endeavor for many. But what if there was a way to make any set of headphones sound even better? The FiiO E02i Rocky Headphone Amplifier for $39 will do just that. It will also add the ability to control your iPhone and comes with a built-in microphone. The bass boost feature in particular will help improve the lows and make music sound more natural.
Wearable Fitness Device – Since Apple is not coming out with an iWatch any time soon (yes, I was hopeful), you will have to look elsewhere when it comes to wearable fitness devices. The three top fitness bands are the Jawbone Up for $129, the Fitbit Flex for $99, and the Nike Fuelband for $149. ArsTechnica has a great comparison of the three  this past summer and felt that the Fitbit (see disclosure) came out on top. What was not considered in the review was the Fitbit Force for $129 which includes a clock.
Touch Screen Stylus – About the only place that I have used a stylus with an iPhone was at the Apple store to sign for a purchase. Other than that, I have only used stylus with my iPad. And I have certainly collected many, many styli over the years. One of the best that has been in my collection for a while now is the Wacom Bamboo Stylus Solo for $19. If you are looking for something with a finer tip to it, then the see-through disk on the Adonit Jot Flip Stylus for $35 will have you wondering why you ever thought a rubber tipped stylus was ever so desirable.
Touch Sensitive Gloves – What would a holiday gift guide be without listing seasonal gloves? In years past, the trend was to make the finger tips of a good pair of gloves work reasonably well on a touch screen. But this year with the iPhone 5S having the iTouch ID, those solutions just wont cut it. Instead, consider fingerless gloves like the Isotoner Hybrid Convertible Fingerless Gloves for $38. The top section of these gloves pull back to reveal the wearer’s bare finger tips, and more importantly their fingerprints.
SanDisk Connect Media Drive - Even though the newest iPads have capacities up to 128GB, that is still not enough storage to keep one’s favorite music, videos, and photos on. When traveling, and especially if you do not what to store a copy on each family members device, consider getting a SanDisk Connect Media Drive for just $99. It has the ability to stream its multimedia contents to up to five devices simultaneously. And the fact that it is battery operated makes it the perfect choice for families on the go.
Disclosure: Fitbit is backed by True Ventures, a venture capital firm that is an investor in the parent company of Gigaom. Om Malik, founder of Gigaom, is also a venture partner at True.
