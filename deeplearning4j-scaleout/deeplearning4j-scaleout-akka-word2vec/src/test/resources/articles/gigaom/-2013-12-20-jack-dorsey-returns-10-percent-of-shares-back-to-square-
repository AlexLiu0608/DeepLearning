In what Fortune described as an “uncommon move,” Square CEO Jack Dorsey  has voluntarily given back 10 percent of his shares in Square back to the mobile payments company. Dorsey currently owns 30 percent of the company, so the shares add up to 3 percent of equity or as much as $150 million. The move greatly increases the pool of shares available in Square, and Fortune attributed the move to Dorsey’s interest in rewarding his company’s 700 employees. Dorsey’s stake remains at roughly $877 million.
