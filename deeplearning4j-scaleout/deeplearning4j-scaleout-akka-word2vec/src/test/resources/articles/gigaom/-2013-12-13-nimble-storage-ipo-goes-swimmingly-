San Jose-based Nimble , trading on the NYSE under ticker symbol NMBL, makes hybrid storage systems that mix fast flash drives with more traditional (and less expensive) disk drives, knitting them together with management software.   In storage overall it competes with all-flash players like IPO-bound Pure Storage  and Nimbus and EMC’s new XtremIO flash arrays as well as hybrid arrays from EMC, NetApp and others.
