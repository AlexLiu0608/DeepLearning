Summary:
Samsung may be pushing further into brick-and-mortar retails stores now that it has hired a former Apple Store designer. The company could benefit from stores that explain how the Galaxy line of devices work best together.
Samsung may have something new in store for its battle with Apple: A new take on the retail store itself. Former Apple Store designer Tim Gudgel is a new Samsung employee according to The Information (subscription required) as the company is reportedly considering “a deeper investment in U.S. retail.”
Samsung currently takes a different approach than that of Apple when it comes to product retailing. Instead of costly, dedicated stores, Samsung has pop-up areas in shopping malls and dedicated areas in Best Buy locations. The hiring of Gudgel signals a possible change in that strategy. Samsung arguably has plenty of retail products to support a full store-front at this point, moving well beyond computers, monitors and appliances to a plethora of mobile devices, connected wearables  and new accessories .
Gudgel is actually the second former Apple retail resource snagged by Samsung: Earlier this year, Michael Forrest joined Samsung according to The Information, where he’s been working on a plan to merge the Samsung Galaxy brand with a retail experience. It’s a smart move as the Galaxy line started out in 2010 as Samsung’s interpretation of a single device line, similar to that of Apple’s iPhone .
Of course, the difference here is that Galaxy is a line of branded devices that vary widely, unlike Apple’s few products to meet many needs. That’s where the challenge lies with Samsung’s new retail specialists: Getting consumers to believe that multiple Galaxy products work best together, thereby increasing overall product sales for Samsung.
