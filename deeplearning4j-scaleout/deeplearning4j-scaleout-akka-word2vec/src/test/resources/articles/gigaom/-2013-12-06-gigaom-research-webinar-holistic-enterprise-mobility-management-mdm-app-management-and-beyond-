Summary:
In this Gigaom Research webinar, the panelists will examine the necessary steps to build a comprehensive EMM strategy that grows with the business. They will also discuss the future of mobility management, current approaches in the marketplace and strategies for extending unified management to mobile devices and applications.
Mobility has increased management and security demands while robbing the IT department of much of its power to enforce policy. Modern CIOs must decide not whether to support an ever-widening range of devices and apps but how, without disrupting ever-more-powerful lines of business.
Early bucketed attempts at enterprise mobility management have yielded mixed results. Pure mobile device management (MDM) approaches have provided excellent baseline security and device awareness, but they have proved a blunt tool for other needs. Mobile application management (MAM) technologies have added security with minimum impact to users’ workflows, but they do not provide a comprehensive view of the user device. Neither MDM nor MAM — alone or together — provide IT the resources they need to fully manage and support users. While mobility promises to make the enterprise more productive in the long term, its rapid evolution has slowed the arrival of a true, comprehensive management solution that provides the control, flexibility and reporting businesses have come to expect in traditional IT management.
In this webinar , our panel will address these topics:
How can IT keep pace with change without compromising manageability or security?
What are the disconnects between current EMM tools and business needs?
What are key considerations for mobility outside the security bubble?
How suited are traditional unified management tools for mobile devices and users?
Who are the stakeholders and how must IT integrate them into decision making?
What is the future of mobility management?
