Good news for all the last-minute holiday shoppers out there: Walmart is planning to offer a big sale on Apple’s latest iPhones, along with a few other Apple products, starting Friday, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The iPhones are the best part of the sale. You’ll be able to pick up a new iPhone 5c with a two-year contract from AT&T or Verizon for just $27, down from its original $99 on-contract price. The iPhone 5s will see a discount as well, available for $127 with a two-year contract, down from $199. There’s no word on Sprint or T-Mobile devices, so it looks like those users will be out of luck.
You can also pick up an original iPad mini for the same $299 as usual, but it’ll come with a $50 gift card (the report doesn’t say whether the gift card will be for Apple or for Walmart, though I imagine it’s the latter). And $30 iTunes gift cards will be on sale for $25.
Though $27 for an iPhone 5c is a great deal, $127 for an iPhone 5s is arguably the better one. After all, Walmart already sells the iPhone 5c for $45 with a contract, whereas the iPhone 5s has remained pretty firm at $199.
The sale starts at 8AM Friday and prices will remain in effect through December 24 or while supplies last.
