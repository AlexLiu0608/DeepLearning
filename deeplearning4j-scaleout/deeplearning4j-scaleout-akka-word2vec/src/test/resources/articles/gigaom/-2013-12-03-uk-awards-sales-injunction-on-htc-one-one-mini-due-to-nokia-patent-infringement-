Finding an HTC One or HTC One Mini in the U.K. is about to get more difficult. On Tuesday, Nokia earned an injunction ruling against both products for patent infringement . The One Mini wonâ€™t be sold after December 6 as a result, says Bloomberg, although the HTC One has a delayed injunction and can still be sold. No new HTC One products will be imported into the U.K., however, due to the court ruling. HTC reportedly sold 750,000 handsets from January to September in the country, per the court documents.
