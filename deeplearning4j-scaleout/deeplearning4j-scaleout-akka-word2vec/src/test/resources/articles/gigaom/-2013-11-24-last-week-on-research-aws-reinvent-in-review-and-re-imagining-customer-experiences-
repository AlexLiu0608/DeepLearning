This week was another big one for the cloud and for  big data, as Salesforce’s Dreamforce conference took over the streets of San Francisco and the F1 US Grand Prix hit the track in Austin, TX. Over on Gigaom Research, our analysts were also keeping tabs on the latest events, and a recap of this month’s AWS Re:Invent conference was one of our most popular pieces of research.

Cloud:  AWS re:Invent 2013: highlights and analysis
Jo Maitland and Janakiram MSV
Analysts Jo Maitland and Janakiram MSV provide a postmortem of AWS Re:Invent, Amazon’s second annual cloud computing trade show, which wrapped up earlier this month. With packed expo halls and an hectic agenda of over 200 sessions, Amazon showed off its role as the cloud of choice for both startups and enterprises like GE, Shell, and Samsung; Maitland and Janakiram note that “AWS looks like the new Microsoft, with its cloud platform becoming the new Windows.” Their report summarizes the top trends and highlights of the show, including takeaways from Andy Jassy’s keynote and other major topics such as Amazon’s increased focus on the AWS ecosystem, feature announcements made during the show, and other news to emerge from Re:Invent.
Mobile:  Managing the complete customer experience: encouraging engagement with mobile and apps
Peggy Anne Salz
As mobile apps increasingly become the “primary way that users across all demographics access and activate content, services, commerce, and critical business applications,” they are increasingly seen as an important business tool for the customer service experience (and, subsequently, the sales and service channels for a given enterprise). Analyst Peggy Anne Salz takes a close look at these market opportunities, and especially how businesses can customize and reimagine the customer experience to ensure high-value transactions. She cites case studies of innovative mobile app use and implementation by companies such as Wix, General Electric and BT Financial Group, and closes with actionable takeaways and survey data to support her recommendations.
Social:  Moving toward a third way of work: leaving the first and second behind
Stowe Boyd
In his latest weekly update, analyst Stowe Boyd addresses a recent article by Chris Heuer about the supposed death of social business, arguing that social business isn’t dead, but instead that the term has been misinterpreted and is due for a re-examination. Boyd reflects on his response to Heuer’s article, and includes excerpts from the ensuing dialog that points to an ever-changing definition of work, and the constantly-evolving role of social within the workplace. As Boyd notes, “What may be the most difficult thing for the social business cadre to accept is that the core principles of social have already been assimilated into the world of business, perhaps as deeply as they can be at present,” and lays the groundwork for a larger essay on what Boyd calls “the third way of work.”
