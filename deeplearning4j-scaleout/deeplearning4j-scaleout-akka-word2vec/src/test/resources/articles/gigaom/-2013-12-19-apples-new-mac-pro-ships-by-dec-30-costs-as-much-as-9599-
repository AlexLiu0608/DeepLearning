Apple’s new Mac Pro is now available to order , but it doesn’t look like it’ll reach your doorstep by Christmas morning. As of Thursday afternoon, shipping dates for models of the beautiful new machine – which start at $2,999 for a quad-core model and $3,999 for a 6-core option – have slipped to February 2014, a pretty far cry from the Dec. 30 estimate when the Pros first went on sale Thursday morning. It ships to stores as well, so it looks like February is the earliest you can hope to get one.
Out of curiosity, I selected the 6-core model and fully tricked it out with all of the highest-end options available. And if you want an ultra-high-end super-computer, it’s going to cost you. A fully loaded Mac Pro costs a staggering $9,599 – and that’s without a monitor, mouse or keyboard. Throw in a 32” Sharp 4K display (because why not?), along with a wireless mouse and keyboard, and the total climbs to $13,332. And you might want to think about throwing in some AppleCare to protect that investment.
That’s no small price to pay, but hey, at least you’ll know you’ve got the most powerful configuration available – until next year.
