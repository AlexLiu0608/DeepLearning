Summary:
Publishing analytics startup Parse.ly has released a report highlighting the top screen sizes on which its customers’ readers are consuming news content. Desktops and laptops still dominate overall, but Apple is king of the mobile devices.
Analytics startup Parse.ly has released its third bi-monthly “Authority Report” on Wednesday, and the big finding is that the majority of traffic for some top online publishers still comes via laptop and desktop computers.
The company analyzed the screen sizes of devices that its customers’ readers use to access their content, and found that about 60 percent of all traffic came from devices with screen ratios of 16:9 or 16:10, indicating it came mostly from laptops or desktops. Overall, traffic from mobile devices accounts for between 10 and 20 percent of traffic, peaking at nearly 20 percent in the evenings and with most of it — at least 13.8 percent — coming from Apple iPads or iPhones.

This is the third time Parse.ly has released a report on traffic trends. A highlight of its first report was Feedly’s dominance as the reader app of choice in lieu of Google Reader, while its second highlighted the high percentage of traffic coming from so-called dark search. There’s an interactive version of the screen-size chart (and a couple others) available online.
