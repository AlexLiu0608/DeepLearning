Summary:
Parents, this app wants to quantify your diaper changes. Ins & Outs is an activity tracker for babies, and it’s been built by the Janus Friis-backed product incubator The Factory.
Every parent of a newborn has been there: The first few weeks, you try to keep track of everything. Number of diapers, feedings, sleep. And because the latter is lacking, the notes you scribble down on paper charts at 4 a.m. quickly become guessing games of their own. That’s why a new $5 iPhone app called Ins & Outs aims to simplify things with an activity tracker for the first few months.
Interesting about Ins & Outs is that it’s the first app coming out of the Factory , a new product incubator backed by Skype and Rdio co-founder Janus Friis and staffed by a number of former Rdio employees. The Factory wants to reinvent the way startups build products by reusing code and sharing equity across the company. Here’s what I wrote about the Factory back in June:
“The Factory’s serialized product creation is also an answer to something (Factory CTO Todd) Berman and Sigurdsson have seen happen to many startups in their early stages. Instead of focusing on innovation, engineers are forced to reinvent the wheel over and over again to create yet another sign-up mechanism, contact list or sharing feature. “The way software companies are being built is incredibly wasteful right now,” Berman told me. The Factory wants to solve this problem by repurposing a lot of components, and writing code from day one with reusability in mind.”
Berman told me Thursday that Ins & Outs will be a “first of many” apps coming out of the company, and that his team already focused on “a lot of reusable infrastructure” when developing Ins & Outs.
