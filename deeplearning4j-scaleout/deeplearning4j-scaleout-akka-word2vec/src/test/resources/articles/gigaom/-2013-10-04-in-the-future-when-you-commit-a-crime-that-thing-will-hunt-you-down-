Q: What runs like a horse but sounds like a jet ski? A:  Wild Cat, a prototype four-legged robot from Boston Dynamics which can already run fast (16 mph) on a flat surface. Plans call for it to handle more rugged terrain — like say, battle fields or (gulp) city streets.
Wild Cat, funded by the government’s  DARPA Maximum Mobility and Manipulation (M3 program.  is based on “Cheetah”,  which Boston Dynamics claims is the world-fastest robot — capable of outrunning Usain Bolt at about 29 mph.
