Summary:
What’s on menu this weekend? How about Paul Walker, future of work in age of anxiety, rise and fall of demand media, the Made in USA premium and why we need bubbles. Plus much more.
I am traveling this coming week, so I wanted to make sure I got a great package of articles in your hands before I took off. Here are some of my recommendations for the week:
Snowden & Greenwald: The men who leaked the secrets : Rolling Stone magazine’s Janet Reitman takes a comprehensive look at the two of the most talked about people of 2013.
Epic Fail: The Rise & Fall of Demand Media : A fascinating look at the content farm company by Variety ’s Andrew Wallenstein.
That ‘Made in USA’ Premium : It night not be worth it for some, but I like to support local commerce and that means paying a little premium.
The economy almost certainly needs bubbles : Michael Sankowski makes a compelling case.
What its like to fail : A former sitcom writer shares his story of going from spotlight to the streets.
Paul Walker: 1973-2013 , rest in peace.
