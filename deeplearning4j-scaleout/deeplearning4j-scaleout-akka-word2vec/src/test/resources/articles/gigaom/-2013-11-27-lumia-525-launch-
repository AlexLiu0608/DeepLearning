Perfect, this will actually fix my biggest complaint about this phone. It’s nearly as responsive as my HTC 8X. I’m just miffed that I can’t get the same browsing or app experience. IE limits you to 6 tabs, on top of that it will reload them if you have more than 1 tab in memory while other apps have been used. If you only use ie, you’re still limited to two or three actual tabs staying loaded on the device. Go over those secret limits and the device has to download the site again. Why couldn’t it just use the onboard storage as a cache to hold the data there  if it needs more physical memory? It should work just like linux swap or windows virtual memory instead of wasting data and time.
