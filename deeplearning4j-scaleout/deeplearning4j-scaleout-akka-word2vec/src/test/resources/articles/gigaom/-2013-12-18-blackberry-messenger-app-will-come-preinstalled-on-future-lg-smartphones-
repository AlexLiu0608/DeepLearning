Summary:
BlackBerry has struck a deal to preinstall its BBM app on some future LG smartphones, starting with the G Pro Lite.
BlackBerry’s device business might be in big trouble , but BlackBerry Messenger has gained a new surge in popularity , thanks to new Android and iOS apps. And it looks like BBM will be coming to even more users, thanks to a deal BlackBerry has struck with LG to preinstall its messaging app on some of its future smartphones.
Last month BlackBerry announced that BBM would soon come preloaded on a variety of Android phones from “leading OEMs across Africa, India, Indonesia, Latin America and the Middle East.” And it looks like LG is the first big OEM to adopt BBM.
This is good news for BlackBerry, which can use all the help it can get right now in its effort to remain relevant. According to Executive Vice President for BBM Andrew Bocking, “We’re extremely pleased that LG Electronics will help bring their customers a more seamless experience with BBM by preloading the app, starting with the G Pro Lite in key markets.”
It doesn’t appear the app will be modified for LG’s phones, and it will still be available for all other Android users to download from Google Play.  The first LG phone to ship with BBM preloaded will be the aforementioned G Pro Lite.
According to BlackBerry, the BBM experience on both Android and iOS will continue to evolve over the coming months, with support for BBM channels, as well as BBM Voice and Video calling.
