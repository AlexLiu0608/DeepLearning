It looks like those buzzy rumors floating around earlier this month are true: The Wall Street Journal reports that the streaming music platform has raised another $250 million in new funding, led by Technology Crossover Ventures. This latest round of funding means that the Swedish company is valued above $4 billion. According to the report, the money will likely go into the expansion of new markets like Japan, adding to the 32 markets the company already serves. Spotify has yet to comment on the deal.
