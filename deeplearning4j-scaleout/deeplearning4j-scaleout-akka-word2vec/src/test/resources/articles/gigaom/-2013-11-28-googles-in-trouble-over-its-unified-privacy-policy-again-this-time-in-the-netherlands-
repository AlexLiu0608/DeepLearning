Just days after a Berlin court decided Google’s privacy policy and terms of use were too vague , the Dutch data protection authority has done much the same. In a Thursday statement , the the watchdog’s chairman, Jacob Kohnstamm, said the U.S. firm didn’t give users any option or much transparency when it comes to combining their data from different Google services : “Google spins an invisible web of our personal data, without our consent. And that is forbidden by law.” The company will now need to attend a hearing, after which the privacy regulator will decide whether to take enforcement measures.
