Summary:
Private PaaS pioneer Apprenda will use its new funding to expand into Europe and build strategic partnerships with other vendors.
Apprenda, the company behind a .NET- and Java-focused platform-as-a-service, now has $16 million in new funding courtesy of a Series C round led by Safeguard Scientifics.

The Clifton Park, N.Y.-based company will use some of its new funding to open a European office and to build strategic alliances with other vendors, said Apprenda CEO Sinclair Schuller.
“We’re starting to get some really big customers — not just Fortune 1000 but Fortune 100 — the only thing holding us back is capital,” he added.
Apprenda has long claimed JPMorganChase, Diebold, Honeywell and Memorial Sloan Ketterling hospital as key accounts; Schuller said the company will announce some other big wins later. Boeing is apparently another customer.

The knock on PaaS as a category has been that many big companies may test the waters but decline to deploy important applications in a public cloud platform. Schuller has long said private PaaS, specifically Apprenda, does not have that problem.
Safeguard Managing Director Philip Moyer will join Apprenda’s board of directors. Current Apprenda backers Ignition Partners and New Enterprise Associates also chipped into the round, which brings total funding to about $32 million.
