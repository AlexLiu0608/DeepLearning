Summary:
100 million isn’t quite the milestone it once was, but Kik’s recent growth spurt is elevating the messaging startup above the crowded mid-tier of OTT app providers.
Kik Interactive revealed today that its messaging app has surpassed the 100 million registered user mark, meaning it’s doubled its user base in just eight months . Keep in mind that’s total registered users (people who’ve downloaded the app and created an account), not monthly active users, but since April Kik has been adding about 200,000 new accounts per day, the company said.
It used to be that 100 million was a huge milestone, but in the skyrocketing market for over-the-top (OTT) communications apps it’s become more of a mile marker. KakaoTalk, Line, WeChat, Viber and Tango have already exceeded 100 million users. Global leader WhatsApp has surpassed 300 million monthly users , and the mobile messaging apps for companies like Facebook, BlackBerry and Skype command an impressive share of the messaging market .
Kik, however, looks to be rising out of that crowded middle tier of messaging providers. It credits its recent growth to the launch of its Cards feature last year . The mini-apps have been a hit with old and new users alike, Kik said, and customers have added 145 million of the HTML5 applications to their apps since launch.
