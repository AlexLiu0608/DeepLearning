Once again, it’s time to watch the ball drop on Time’s Square. And if you’re not in New York, or not up for waiting in the cold, there are once again a number of options to watch all the action on the web, on your iPad or on your mobile phone.
The dropping of the ball on Times Square is a tradition that goes back more than a 100 years, and every year, millions of people from all around the world turn in to watch it live. Of course it’s on TV, but you can also tune in without cable, or without a TV at all, for that matter.

The official webcast of the part is starting at 5:55pm ET, and lasting more than six hours, until 12:15am ET, to be precise. The commercial-free webcast will once again be hosted by Allison Hagendorf.
Roku owners can watch the action live through the Livestream channel on their device.
Twitter’s Vine team will be sharing the best Vines from Times Square through its app via “Times Square NYE” and on Twitter @NYE2014Vine .
