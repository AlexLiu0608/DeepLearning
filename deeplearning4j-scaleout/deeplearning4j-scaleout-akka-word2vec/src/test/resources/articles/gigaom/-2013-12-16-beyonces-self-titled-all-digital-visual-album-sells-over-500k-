Pop icon Beyonce surprised the world on Friday when her self-titled fifth album dropped in the iTunes store without warning — complete with music videos for each track. Billboard reports that the so-called “visual album” is a major success, selling more than 550,000 copies in three days and landing the diva at the top of the Billboard 200. Bey isn’t the first artist to experiment with new album formats — her husband Jay-Z released his latest album, Magna Carta Holy Grail, for free to Samsung owners earlier this year — but this record’s creative “visual” nature may be the key to digital album success.
