Summary:
As expected, there’s an official recall for the HP Chromebook 11 power unit. The laptop was voluntarily removed from retail shelves last month amid reports of overheating; customers can now get a replacement charger.
The power unit to recharge the HP Chromebook 11 was officially recalled on Tuesday with around 145,000 units affected. The Verge found the information for affected customers on the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission website, which describes the process to follow for the recalled product.  HP and Google jointly decided to voluntarily pull the HP Chromebook 11 from retail shelves in November .
According to the U.S. CPSC, “Google has received nine reports of chargers overheating and melting during use. There is one report of a small burn to a consumer and one report of minor property damage to a pillow from an overheating charger.”
The HP Chromebook 11 is unique among Chromebooks in that it charges over a micro-USB port, similar to smartphones and tablets.
That means a charger for those devices can also re-charge the HP Chromebook 11, although it may take longer to charge. The included charger provides a higher voltage. Customers can now request a new charger through the recall process so that their HP Chromebook 11 again charges at the fast rate.
