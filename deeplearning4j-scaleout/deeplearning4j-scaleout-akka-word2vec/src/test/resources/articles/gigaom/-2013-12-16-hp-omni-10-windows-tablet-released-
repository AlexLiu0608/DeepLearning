Summary:
It’s been a long wait, but the HP Omni 10 Windows tablet with full HD screen is here. The slate has one of the fastest Atom chips available and retails for $399. A keyboard attachment would make this tablet a bit more compelling.
After a September announcement with an expected November launch, the HP Omni 10 is finally available in December. The Windows 8.1 tablet costs $399 direct from the Microsoft Store and as of Monday shows as in stock, per Liliputing . The tablet retails for $50 more than the Asus Transformer T100 I recently purchased to try a hybrid tablet / laptop , but it does offer some better hardware. Unfortunately, it doesn’t come with a keyboard like the T100 does.
So what do you get for the $50 premium? Instead of the 1366 x 768 resolution panel of the T100, the Omni 10 crams a high-resolution 1920 x 1200 display into the tablet. It also has a slightly faster Intel Atom (BayTrail) processor, the Z3770 running at 1.46 GHz. HP says you can expect around 8.5 hours of battery life on the Omni 10, which is comparable to other slates in this price range. Like the T100, HP’s tablet includes 2 GB of memory and 32 GB of storage.
The unfortunate part is that HP doesn’t have a keyboard accessory for the Omni 10. After using the T100 for a bit and having replaced that with a Surface Pro 2 , that’s not an ideal situation. You can definitely use a Windows tablet without a keyboard and trackpad, but I think the experience is optimal with them. HP’s tablet does support Bluetooth, which at least gives you to the option to add a wireless keyboard and/or a mouse.
