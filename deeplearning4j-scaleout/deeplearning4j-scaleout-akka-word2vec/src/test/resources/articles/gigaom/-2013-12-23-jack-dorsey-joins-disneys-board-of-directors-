The Walt Disney Company announced Monday that  Square CEO and Twitter co-founder and chairman Jack Dorsey has been elected to the company’s Board of Directors. Dorsey will serve as “an independent director,” and stand at a meeting in March of next year.
Dorsey is not the only Silicon Valley face on Disney’s board — Facebook COO Sheryl Sanberg has been a board fixture since 2010. But it’s hard to not draw comparisons to another former Disney director and tech luminary, Steve Jobs. Jobs served on the board until his death in 2011, and his family still has a rather large stake in the company .
After the announcement, Dorsey, of course, tweeted about it:
