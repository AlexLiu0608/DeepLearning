Just found the podcast a few weeks ago from a G+ post, and have to say, I look forward to the next every week. Thanks for putting it out there.
Whenever feedback is brought up, I feel like I should say something, but I don’t just live Chrome. It’s a mix of Android devices, a Chromebook, and a Manjaro Linux laptop running Chromium browser, so here’s a app that works on all of them; Pushbullet [https://www.pushbullet.com/] for sending small file and links between devices with push notifications. Brilliant!
Happy belated Thanksgiving, and keep up the good work.
