Show notes for this episode:
The Xbox One goes on sale on 11/22 for $499. You’ll find more about the game console on Microsoft’s official website.
At launch, the Xbox will offer access to entertainment apps like Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Prime and Redbox Instant, but there’s no YouTube app available for the One just yet.
The Xbox One voice search is powered by deep learning , as our own Derrick Harris explains.
The Xbox One requires users to have a cable box to watch live TV, and uses the same kind of HDMI daisy-chain that also was used by Google TV to integrate TV, gaming and online video apps.
Check out our interview with Microsoft’s Sr. Principal Creative Director Carl Ledbetter to learn about the industrial design of the Xbox One.
Are you going to buy an Xbox One? If so, how important is that live TV integration for you? or are you sticking with the Xbox 360, or maybe even buying a PS4?
