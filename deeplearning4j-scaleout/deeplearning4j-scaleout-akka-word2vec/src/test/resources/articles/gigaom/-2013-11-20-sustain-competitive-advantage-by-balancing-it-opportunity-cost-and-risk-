Summary:
CIOs are embracing new technologies and service models to make IT faster and cheaper and to deliver competitive advantage to the business.
We’re at an interesting inflection point in IT. While technologies change, the need for sustained competitive advantage remains constant in business. Success still requires balancing opportunity with cost and risk.
The emergence of the cloud enables IT organizations to rapidly deliver a broad range of services to meet the needs of the business. However, with the introduction of hybrid, multicloud architectures, data management and access become increasingly complex. Therefore, it’s critical to build a blended IT environment that marries the flexibility of the cloud with the availability and control of more-traditional IT architectures.
Additionally, flash memory technology changes the way performance is delivered to applications, enabling real time to become an expectation, not an aspiration. Yet many organizations grapple with how and where to implement flash in their IT infrastructure to strike a balance among price, performance and meeting business goals.
NetApp  believes that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to flash. Enterprises need to adopt an application-driven approach that makes the right use of flash at the right place in their infrastructure.
As disruptive technologies such as flash and cloud present IT opportunities, take a long-term view of your organization’s IT architecture and needs. Take a strategic approach that considers all factors — data availability, control, flexibility and scale– to maximize the impact that these new technologies and service models can deliver to your business.
