Simple.tv will launch an app for its over-the-air DVR on Ouya devices next year. The app will bring live and recorded TV to the Android-based game console, provided that users also own Simple.tvâ€™s networked DVR. The company announced Thursday that it will preview an app for Simple.tv at CES in January, where it will also show off a first implementation of a cloud DVR. Simple.tv CEO Mark Ely first told me in July that the company was thinking about adding a cloud-based DVR as a supplemental feature to its device.
