Summary:
Verizon Wireless has introduced a new plan to keep your tablet connected: $5 will get you 300MB of data for 24 hours.
Need to connect your tablet to Verizon’s 4G LTE network, but only for a couple of hours? No problem. The carrier now offers a daily plan that gets you 300MB of data over 24 hours for $5, and you don’t have to pay any activation fees.
You need to have a Verizon SIM in your device in order to get service. When you launch your tablet’s Web browser, you’ll be brought to Verizon’s wireless broadband portal, where you’ll be able to choose the $5 service plan, which will connect you to either 3G or 4G LTE if available. There’s no limit to the amount of times you can do this – you can try it out just once, or use it every day (though in that case, it would probably be cheaper to sign up for a standard Share Everything plan).
I think this is convenient for tablet users that might occasionally need access to cellular service – while traveling, for instance – but don’t want to commit to a monthly plan. $5 seems like a reasonable price, and 300MB is more than enough data to access email and your browse the Web while on the go. If you run through 300MB before your 24 hours is up, you’ll be able to purchase another 300MB of data for $5.
AT&T offers a similar daily plan, though you only get 250MB of data for $5 . And T-Mobile shouldn’t be discounted either – the carrier offers all users 200MB of free data per month just for keeping their tablet on its network.
