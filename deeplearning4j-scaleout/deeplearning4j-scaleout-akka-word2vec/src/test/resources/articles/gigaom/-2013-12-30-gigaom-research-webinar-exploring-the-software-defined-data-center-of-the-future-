Summary:
This Gigaom Research analyst webinar will examine the lessons learned from the first wave of adoption and outline strategies to take advantage of SDDCs without sacrificing control or going over budget. It will also look toward advances in data center technology and how enterprises can build for the future.
The data deluge has fueled the introduction of hyperscale data centers to handle our world’s growing information demands. To increase overall efficiency, the model of the software-defined data center (SDDC)  has emerged to provide a more consolidated, manageable, cost-effective and secure future to handle information. But early adopters have also discovered roadblocks and bottlenecks on the path to prosperity, especially with storage. And like any emerging technology, SDDC has a number of deployment models to choose from, each with its own benefits and trade-offs.
A true SDDC solution virtualizes the server, network and storage levels. The first is well-established and understood, but network virtualization is still young and storage is even more problematic. Extremely fast, relatively low-cost flash drives have revolutionized storage performance and provisioning, but the majority of storage architectures are still not virtualization-ready, and storage management tools are often lacking.
In this webinar , our panel will address these topics:
How are SDDCs being deployed?
What use cases have proved most successful?
What are the current challenges with management tools?
What solutions can address the storage bottlenecks?
Where is SDDC headed?
