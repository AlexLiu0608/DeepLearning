With Black Friday and Cyber Monday behind us, Microsoft is allegedly looking to keep the retail momentum going with its 12 Days of Deals promotion. And a leaked document posted on the forums of Slickdeals purportedly details what you might be able to expect to go on sale from now until December 20.
As you can see, the “doorbuster” deals look particularly good. But according to the calendar, they’re limited to the first 20 customers. Everyone after that will still receive a discount on that day’s chosen product – it just won’t be as steep. The HP Envy 15 , for instance, which regularly costs $899.99, is said to go on sale for $499 for the first 20 customers on December 20. After that it’ll cost $699.
There’s no way to know whether this calendar is authentic, but the Dell Tablet Pro listed here did go on sale for $99 today , lending the list a bit of legitimacy.
Check out the image above for the alleged early bird prices. For everyone else that isn’t planning to make it to a Microsoft store  at the crack of dawn, here are the deals you might be able to expect:
December 9: Dell Tablet Pro 8” for $199
December 10: Garmin Fitness Watch for $129.99 with a $25 gift card
December 11: AT&T Nokia Lumia 1020 for $99
