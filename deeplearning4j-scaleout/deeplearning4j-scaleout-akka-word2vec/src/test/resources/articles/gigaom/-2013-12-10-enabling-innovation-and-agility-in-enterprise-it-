Summary:
Enterprise IT organizations must manage conflicting priorities with too few resources. Companies need to deliver their applications as quickly as possible in order to be competitive and drive innovation in their company. How can IT enable innovation instead of being seen as the roadblock to it?
Enterprise IT organizations face many juxtaposed challenges: Despite a lack of resources, they are under pressure to further reduce costs. They are beholden to the needs of disparate business groups, yet they are often excluded from holistic organizational planning. They are often seen internally as an innovation bottleneck, yet they are bound by security and governance constraints. How can they effectively help their organization create new projects when they spend most of their time keeping the lights on?
In order for a company to stay ahead of the competition and drive innovation, it’s important that it is able to develop and deploy applications as quickly as possible. And IT must support and enable innovation instead of being seen as the roadblock to it.
Stackato by ActiveState was created specifically to solve the diminishing resources and time-to-market challenges of enterprise IT organizations. It helps remove barriers between development, QA, deployment and operational teams by providing a unified self-service IT platform that allows enterprises to quickly deploy, scale and manage applications written with any language or software stack.
“Stackato has enabled a level of empowerment for our developers that previously was not possible”, says Dale McCrory, the principal product manager of ExactTarget. “Instead of quickly developing apps and then running into the brick wall of IT backlogs, developers can literally run with their apps straight to the cloud.”
