Summary:
Google is looking to hire people to bring Chromecast abroad, and a leak hints at an impending launch of HBO Go support.
Google’s Chromecast streaming stick could soon get support for HBO Go: DroidLife discovered earlier this week that Google’s Chromecast product page briefly listed HBO Go as one of the supported apps. The reference has since been removed, but HBO previously said that it was “actively exploring” Chromecast support to its mobile apps.
This wouldn’t be the first time that a Chromecast app prematurely appeared on Google’s website: We spotted some traces of Pandora’s app on the same Chromecast product page in October. A week later, Pandora  officially added Chromecast support to its mobile apps.
In other Chromecast rumors, it looks like Google is working on bringing the streaming stick to other countries. A recently posted job offer for a Product Manager, Chromecast (International) states that the company is looking for “looking for a Product Manager who is passionate about launching consumer products in international markets.” It continues:
“This individual will be responsible for defining and driving the end-to-end Chromecst product experience for countries around the globe. You will be working closely with the Chromecast hardware, software, content, and operations teams to define international product requirements and successfully managing the launches. In addition, you will have an opportunity to work directly with big name developers around the world to bring their content to Chromecast devices.”
In addition to this, Google is also looking to hire a developer advocate and a technical account manager based in the U.K.
Finally, there’s a bit of news on the Chromecast sales front. Google still hasn’t said how many streaming sticks it has sold since launch in July, but at least on Amazon, it seems to be selling well. So well in fact that it remained the best-selling electronics device for weeks, beating not only direct competitors like Apple TV and Roku but even Amazon’s own Kindle devices.
This week, that reign finally came to an end, as Chromecast slipped to the number two spot, behind the new Kindle Fire HD 7” tablet. Apple TV and Roku 3 remained on ranks eight and nine, respectively. Of course, both devices are also are available through a number of additional retailers, whereas Chromecast is only available through Amazon, Best Buy and Google Play.
