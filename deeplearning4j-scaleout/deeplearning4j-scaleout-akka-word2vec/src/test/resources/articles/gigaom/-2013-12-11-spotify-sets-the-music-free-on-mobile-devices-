Music service Spotify is now offering free music on iOS and Android mobile devices. The company announced the news on Wednesday, saying that listeners could shuffle music based on a favorite artist or could tune into self-created playlists or the playlists of other friends on Spotify. Previously, the company offered music in its mobile and web apps for a fee; it will still do so as the new free music service is ad-supported. Customers can stillÂ pay for Spotify Premium for an ad-free experience.
