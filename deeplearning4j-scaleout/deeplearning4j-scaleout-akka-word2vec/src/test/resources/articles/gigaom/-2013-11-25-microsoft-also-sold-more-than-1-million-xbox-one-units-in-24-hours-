Like Sony before it , it seems that Microsoft is benefitting from next-gen hype: the company said that more than a million Xbox One console s were sold in less than 24 hours after launch last Friday â€” a feat that apparently shatters the initial sales record of the Xbox 360. However, its important to note that the Xbox One had a worldwide release while the similar sales numbers of the PlayStation4 were limited to the U.S. and Canada. But the strong reception both consoles have already received is a sign that next-gen fever will hit holiday shoppers hard.
