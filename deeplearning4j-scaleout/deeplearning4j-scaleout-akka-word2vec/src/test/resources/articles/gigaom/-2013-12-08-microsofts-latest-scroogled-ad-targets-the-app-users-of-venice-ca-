Summary:
Microsoft turned up the volume of its Scroogled campaign with another ad showing how Chromebooks are inferior. So much effort on what the company considers a useless product is interesting, and effective.
If the Pawn Stars don’t float your boat, perhaps real people — in Venice, California, that is — who use third-party computer apps will. That’s where Microsoft filmed its latest Scroogled ad aimed against Google’s Chromebook.
The latest ad is surprisingly effective as it focuses squarely on people using Photoshop, Illustrator, and Office, even though there are useful but limited alternatives on the web for each. The spot is far better — and more honest –than the prior ad, which we discussed on this week’s Chrome Show podcast .
Also in this week’s show, we discuss Google Now voice search in Chrome, SSD performance degradation concerns in Chromebooks, and improved Developer Tools for Chrome. Tune in below or download the show right here .
