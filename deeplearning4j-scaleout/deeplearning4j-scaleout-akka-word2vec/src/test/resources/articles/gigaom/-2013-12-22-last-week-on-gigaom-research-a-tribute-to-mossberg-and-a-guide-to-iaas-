We’re in the home stretch of 2013, but winding down this tumultuous year hasn’t been easy. Over the past 12 months, we’ve watched as the Snowden scandal has impacted internet security and data privacy on a global level , Fisker declared bankruptcy while Tesla flourished, and Facebook finally IPO’ed. It’s a lot to keep track of – luckily, we’ve managed to condense some of the year’s biggest tech highlights into this week’s Gigaom Show podcast . Have a quick listen and then check out what our analysts over at Gigaom Research are covering this week, including a report on sensors in the supply chain and a IT leader’s guide to IaaS.

Buyer’s Lens:  Internet of things: sensors and the supply chain
Mike Dover
Analyst Mike Dover takes a look at one of the key pieces of hardware driving the internet of things: sensors. In his latest report, which is targeted for IT buyers, Dover looks specifically at the role of sensors in the supply chain, particularly perishable and fragile goods; by using sensors to gather real-time data, companies can improve throughput times, better meet customer demand, and reduce stockouts and maximize revenue. Dover includes use cases from companies like Union Pacific, an overview of what sensors can manage and track, and the benefits and challenges of integrating sensors and technology powered by the internet of things into a company’s supply chain.
Cloud:  Infrastructure-as-a-Service basics: a guide for IT pros
Janakiram MSV
Analyst Janakiram MSV takes a look at the IaaS market, which is growing at a significant rate, even compared to its cohorts like Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). As the name implies, Janakiram’s report provides a comprehensive guide for IT decision makers who are considering a public cloud IaaS instance and provider, including a brief history of the IaaS market and the types of vendors in the ecosystem, important factors that need to be considered when choosing IaaS. He also provides a detailed list of key players (such as AWS and Rackspace) in today’s market, along with a side-by-side comparison of platforms that enterprise customers should consider.
Consumer: The Mossberg Consumer
Michael Wolf
In his latest analyst blog post, Michael Wolf pays tribute to Walter Mossberg, the veteran technology writer, who published his last column for the Wall Street Journal earlier this week. Wolf reflects on Mossberg’s 20+ years of technology reviews, creating the so-called Mossberg consumer ”by writing for non-technical consumers as his first and only audience.” As a technology analyst, Wolf muses that this “Mossberg consumer” is a vital barometer for the technology market at large – an industry that relies upon the everyday buyer instead of  early adopters for its long-term successes.
