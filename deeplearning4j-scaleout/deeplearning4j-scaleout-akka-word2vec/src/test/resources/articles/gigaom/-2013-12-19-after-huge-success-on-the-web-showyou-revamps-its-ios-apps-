Summary:
Maybe mobile shouldn’t always be first: Showyou saw huge grow after it revamped its website, which it previously ignored because of an app-centric approach.
Social video discovery app maker Showyou plans to revamp its iOS app Thursday, adding a new look that closely resembles the recently relaunched website and strips out a number of unnecessary features. But while the new look is definitely a welcome change — I complained about Showyou’s mobile apps being left behind when the company revamped its site in September — it’s the success that Showyou has seen on the web that other consumer-focused app makers should pay attention to.
For a long time, Showyou followed the mobile-first line of thinking and tried to concentrate as much as possible on mobile app development. The idea was to prompt users who visited the site on mobile devices to install Showyou’s apps, Mark Hall, CEO of Showyou maker Remixation, told me during an interview this week. “We focused on upselling you to download the app,” he said.
But when the company finally relaunched its website with a full mobile experience, traffic skyrocketed:
A lot of that usage is coming from viral spikes of drive-by traffic — users who watch a short video and leave immediately after that. But a significant number of users also ended up installing the iOS app and watching video there for much longer periods of time, leading to significant growth in mobile viewing. And with the app now looking more like the site, chances are that some of those users may stick around for the long haul.
