It’s been a while since 1996, so Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), chairman of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Rep. Greg Walden, chairman of the Communications Subcommittee, said Tuesday that it’s time to rewrite the Communications Act . The plan is to start generating hearings, white papers and the discussions necessary to start this process in 2015. This is a law that governs how communications infrastructure operates, and has its roots in railroad legislation from the 1800s. Since we’re moving beyond the dial-up modems of ’96 and into gigabit connections, an update makes sense. For those who want to follow the legislative action there’s a hashtag (#commsactupdate). Of course.
