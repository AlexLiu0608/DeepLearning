Although most iOS users have chosen to stick with Apple’s preinstalled Maps app , Google Maps for iOS is getting better all the time. The latest update, released on Wednesday and available in the App Store, even manages to bring some Google Now functionality into the mix. The app now lets you sign into your Google account to automatically pull up and display any reservation info it can find for flights, hotels and restaurants.
Introduced on Android back in October , this a really helpful feature that puts all of your information in one place and makes it easier to juggle appointments or map out a commuting route. And this is just Google’s latest move to increase parity of the Google experience between Android and iOS devices.
I’m a longtime Google Maps user on iOS (even for that period of time when it could only be accessed via the Web browser), so I’m happy to see that Google is bringing its latest features to a wider audience. And it makes sense to do so; the company wants users to have the best Google experience possible, even when it isn’t on Android device.
