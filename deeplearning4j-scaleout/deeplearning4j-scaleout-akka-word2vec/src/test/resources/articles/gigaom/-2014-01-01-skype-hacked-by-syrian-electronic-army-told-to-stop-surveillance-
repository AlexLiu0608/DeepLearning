The Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) has voiced some loud opinions on the social media platforms of its latest victim, Skype. The hacker collective wormed its way in to the VoIP service’s Twitter, Facebook and blog, and the content of the posts seem to be directed at Skype’s parent company, Microsoft, as repeated calls to “stop surveillance” were made.
Don't use Microsoft emails(hotmail,outlook),They are monitoring your accounts and selling the data to the governments.More details soon #SEA —

The anti-Microsoft message was retweeted more than 8,000 times and is still available, although Skype has already regained control of its accounts and deleted messages from Facebook and the blog.
While the tactics are nothing new for the SEA, which went after  The Washington Post ,  Twitter and The New York Times in recent attacks, but the content of the message seems intriguing. There’s no doubt that the SEA’s message refers to documents leaked by Edward Snowden  that detail the NSA’s access while monitoring online activities of many programs — including ones by Microsoft.
At this point, the damage has been remedied, but the SEA’s objections are certain to be heard on other platforms soon.
