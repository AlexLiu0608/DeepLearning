After Friday, longstanding music player Winamp will fade from existence , as AOL discontinues support, shuts down the website and erases any possibility of downloading the software. In honor of Winamp’s departure, Spotify has released Spotiamp , a lightweight music player with a strong resemblance to its forbear. Users must subscribe to Spotify Premium to use Spotiamp, but the program will play all playlists, search for music in the classic Winamp style, and play on speakers through Shoutcast . It’s no Winamp, but it might ease the sting for those who will lose support for their favorite music player.
