Summary:
Moped’s failed messaging service will shut down at the end of the month, but its features will probably prove a lot more useful as part of the more successful Wunderlist task management apps.
The Wunderlist task management app should soon gain new communications features, after Berlin-based developer 6Wunderkinder acquired source code from failed local messaging outfit Moped.
In a terse blog post late Thursday, Moped said it had been acquired by 6Wunderkinder, and that its own service would shut down on 31 December. However, a 6Wunderkinder company spokesperson subsequently said this was a “technology acquisition only” and that the firm had not acquired the Moped brand or hired its team, led by Schuyler Deerman.
“Although we can’t yet share any details on exactly how we will utilise Moped’s real time cross platform messaging in the future, we can say that communication is an essential part of team collaboration,” the spokesperson said in an email.
The terms of the deal haven’t been disclosed, though my guess is that 6Wunderkinder — which recently pulled in a $19 million, Sequoia-led funding round — didn’t pay very much.
Moped, which shared investors Earlybird with 6Wunderkinder, started life by positioning itself as a sort of Twitter-direct-messages rival , but it didn’t really have enough to differentiate it from rising platforms such as WhatsApp and Viber. Then it pivoted towards the business market this year, integrating with Dropbox.
Moped frankly didn’t have much of a future, but it’s not hard to see how its functionality could blend well into Wunderlist, and the Wunderlist Pro app in particular. Wunderlist already gained commenting functionality earlier this year. The pro app is aimed at small businesses and other team environments, and a strong messaging and file-sharing feature could help it develop into a more fully-fledged toolkit.
This article was updated at 3.15am PT to reflect the fact that 6Wunderkinder only bought Moped’s source code.
