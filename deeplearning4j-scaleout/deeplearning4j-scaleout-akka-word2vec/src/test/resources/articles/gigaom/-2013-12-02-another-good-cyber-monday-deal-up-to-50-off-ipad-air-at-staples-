If you forgot to pick up a new tablet on Black Friday, you can still score a good deal on one today. There are plenty of Cyber Monday discounts on Apple devices floating around out there, but the best one I’ve seen so far is at Staples. If you’re looking to pick up a new iPad Air , you can get the 16GB, space gray, Wi-Fi-only model for $449 – a $50 discount. Other models are discounted as well, mostly by $20 – $30. The deal is being offered until midnight or supplies run out. But if Apple isn’t your thing, you can nab a Kindle Fire HD or HDX from Amazon for $50 off as well .
