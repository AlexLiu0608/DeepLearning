Summary:
Apple updated its Find My iPhone app last week with some helpful new features. Here’s a primer on how to locate and keep track of all your various Apple devices using the service.
Each time you get a new device from Apple, in addition to adding it to your backup strategy and  registering it with your other devices on Apple’s support profile , it is also a good idea to ensure that you can locate it using iCloud’s “Find My iPhone” services. With the enhanced iCloud Lost Mode feature of Find my iPhone introduced last week along with iOS 6, Apple has made locating and recovering a lost device a whole lot easier.  You can use the following as a guide to learn how to get everything set up.
How it works on your wireless devices
Your iPhone as well as your WiFi+ Cellular iPads are connected to the internet almost constantly. These devices also come with a built-in GPS receiver that can pinpoint your exact location. So they not only know where they are, they also can communicate their location to the iCloud.
To configure your iOS device , all you need to do is the following:
Launch the Settings app and go to the iCloud section.
Switch on the “Find my iPhone,” “Find my iPod,” or “Find my iPad” setting.
Goto the Privacy settings and select Location Services.
Switch on the “Location Services” and switch on the “Find My iPhone,” “Find my iPod” or “Find My iPad” setting.
How it works on your Wi-Fi devices
For Apple devices that only have Wi-Fi capabilities — say an iPod touch or iPad without cell service or your Mac — the way they communicate their position is a little different. They utilize what is known as the MAC address (or machine address) of the Wi-Fi access point that they are connected to. This is then used to search a database where most, but not all, Wi-Fi access points have their locations stored. When these Wi-Fi only devices establish internet connectivity, they will assume that they are at the pre-determined location of the Wi-Fi access point. So while these Apple devices may not know where they are exactly, they can figure out where the Wi-Fi access point they are connected to claims to be located.
To configure your OS X device , do the following:
Launch the System Preferences application and go to the iCloud section.
Switch on the “Find my Mac” setting.
Go to the Security and Privacy settings, click on Privacy and select Location Services.
Check “Enable Location Services.”
Locating all of your stuff
This is where using a shared account for all of your family’s Apple devices can pay off. The iCloud account that you use for the Find My iPhone service does not have to be the primary iCloud account that you use on the device.  If you have turned on the Find My iPhone service using the same iCloud account on all of your devices, then you will be able to track and locate all of your devices using that same account.
To locate any of your devices, you must use the iCloud account that you enabled the “Find My” services with. You can then use the Find My iPhone iOS app on your iPhone , iPod touch or iPad, or you can log on to the iCloud service through Safari on your Mac . Once logged on, the list of devices being tracked with that particular iCloud account will each update their location on the map.
What to do after you have found your stuff
If it is not where you expected it to be, you do have a few options. Here are some of them  available using various iCloud services:
Notify When Found –  If the device is not able to locate itself, or connect to the internet, you will not be able to find it.  Rather than constantly monitor the screen until it shows up, you can have a message sent to you when it does come online and has an updated location to report.  Simply check “Notify Me When Found” for the device you are trying to locate.
Play Sound - If it is lost and nearby, you can use the iCloud service to have your device play a loud sound until you find it.  The sound will be audible even if you have muted your speakers or turned down the volume.  This will work if the device is online, even if the location of the device cannot be determined.
Lost Mode (iOS only) – This is new. For your iOS devices, you can send a message to the device hoping that if someone reads the message, they will give you a call and let you know everything is alright.  This will also lock down the device using the passcode you have already established on the device, or let you lock the device remotely with a new passcode.
Lock (OS X only) - For Macs, you can still lock down the device, but you cannot send a telephone number accompanied by a message.  This makes sense since the lock screen on OS X does not have the ability to display a message like the lock screen on iOS devices.  So this option is really more handy if you leave work in a hurry, and didn’t log off before you left.  Be sure you can retrieve the device once you do decide to lock it remotely.  After that, your Mac cannot be erased until it is unlocked.  And the only way to unlock is by having the device in your hands.
Erase - There are those unfortunate occasions where your device has either been stolen, or is in a location that you do not trust and cannot get to quickly. In such instances, you can elect to erase the device entirely.  Once erased, the files and configurations on the device cannot be restored except from a backup of the device.
