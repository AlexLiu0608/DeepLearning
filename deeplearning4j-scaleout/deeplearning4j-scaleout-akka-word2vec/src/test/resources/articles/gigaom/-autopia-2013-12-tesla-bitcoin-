Someone’s bought a Tesla Model S with Bitcoins. Yup, Bitcoins. It isn’t just a first for Tesla Motors, but for cars.
Lamborghini of Newport Beach had a lightly used, white Model S with the 85 kilowatt-hour battery pack and performance package on sale. Such a car would retail for more than $110,000 new. Although the dealer didn’t say what the Tesla sold for , the Bitcoin buyer would’ve had to shell out around 1,000 units of the virtual currency, assuming the car is new.
“That’s right, an electronic currency was used to purchased a fully electric vehicle,” the dealer noted on its website. “Lamborghini Newport Beach is proud to announce that we are fully capable of accepting Bitcoin as payment for vehicles. We are excited to be opening the door to this new currency.”
It’s important to note that the sale was made by an independent dealer and not Tesla, which, last we heard, isn’t accepting Bitcoins. At least, not yet.
