Nokia’s Here Maps app have provided iOS users with an alternative to Apple’s built-in offering, but it looks like fans will need to find a new substitute. Nokia has pulled Here Maps from the Apple App Store , citing changes made to iOS 7.
In a statement made to Engadget, a Nokia spokesperson said:
We have made the decision to remove our HERE Maps app from the Apple App Store because recent changes to iOS 7 harm the user experience. iPhone users can continue to use the mobile web version of HERE Maps under m.here.com, offering them location needs, such as search, routing, orientation, transit information and more, all completely free of charge.
It isn’t clear exactly what changes affect the user experience, but my guess is that the app’s removal is more likely due to a lack of major traction on iOS. Studies have shown that most iPhone users stick with Apple Maps . And I imagine many others, myself included, still prefer to use Google’s offering. Here Maps gave users the ability to sync mapping data for use offline, but it never really took off for iOS. At this point, I imagine that updating it for the latest version of iOS requires more of Nokia’s time and resources than it’s worth.
You can still access Here Maps through your iPhone’s browser. And Nokia still plans to support the app across Android, Firefox OS and Tizen.
