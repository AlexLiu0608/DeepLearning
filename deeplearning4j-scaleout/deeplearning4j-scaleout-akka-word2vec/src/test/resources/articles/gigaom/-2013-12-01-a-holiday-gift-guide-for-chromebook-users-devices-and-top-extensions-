Summary:
Looking to buy a new Chromebook for yourself or as a gift? On this week’s Chrome Show podcast, we suggest which is worth the look, along with five “must have” Chrome extensions to get you started.
With many new Chromebook models now available, which one might make for a good gift? Don’t worry, the $1,299 Pixel isn’t our recommendation – unless money is no object of course! Instead, you can get a solid Chrome OS experience by spending at least $1,000 less. And for new Chromebook users, we have a handful of suggested Chrome extensions to help get folks started.
Tune in below for our full weekly Chrome Show or download it here ; aside from our Chrome gift guide, we discuss some of the latest news that will shape the future of Chrome and Chrome OS.
