It appears that LG and Google might have made some slight tweaks to the Nexus 5 production line. New device owners on the XDA Developers forum are reporting that phones fresh off the line show some minor physical differences from the ones that were shipped at launch.
As you can see in the photo above, one of the potential changes include slightly bigger speaker holes, which could remedy the low speaker volume issue some users reported.
And you can’t quite tell from the photo, but the user that submitted these images claims the phone’s somewhat loose physical buttons have been stiffened as well.
Finally, the SIM card tray appears to protrude from the phone a little less than before.
All of these potential changes are welcome, but none of them are substantial, so chances are you might not even realize them. I’m curious, though – if you’re a Nexus 5 owner, have you noticed any of these issues on your device?
