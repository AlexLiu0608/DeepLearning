Summary:
The larger display of Apple’s iPad is the perfect palette for Yahoo Weather. The new app makes its way from iPhone to iPad today and provides stunning photos relevant to your location. Oh, and it’s pretty good at weather forecasts too.
It could be a beautiful day or an overcast downpour and I wouldn’t care: The weather looks great on my iPad now that Yahoo Weather is available . The company released an iPad version of its mobile Weather app for iOS on Monday, following a launch for iPhone and iPod touch back in April . The newest version is every bit as gorgeous to look at as the old, regardless of the weather outside.
Yahoo is still integrating relevant photos from its Flickr property; all of these are user-generated and curated to look fantastic and appropriate for your location’s weather. The app also allows the sharing of local weather conditions, complete with a photo, to Twitter, Facebook and text or email contacts.
Ever since Yahoo released its Weather app for iOS, I’ve used it on my iPhone for the smart layout, slick transitions, pretty photos, and of course, the actual forecast. The free app, now available in the iTunes App Store, is going to handle the same duties on my iPad Air; I think it looks even better on the bigger screen.
