Thanks to a UBS note from Monday we now have some good data on broadband usage at Time Warner Cable. The investment bank issued a note saying that TWC’s CEO-designate Rob Marcus said online viewing is up (although not a replacement for pay TV), and is increasing the demand for broadband. That demand is up 40 percent year over year with an average consumption of 50 GB per month and a median of 20 GB per month. That’s driving the introduction of faster tiers, although TWC will keep usage caps at the low end to appeal to more price-sensitive subscribers.
