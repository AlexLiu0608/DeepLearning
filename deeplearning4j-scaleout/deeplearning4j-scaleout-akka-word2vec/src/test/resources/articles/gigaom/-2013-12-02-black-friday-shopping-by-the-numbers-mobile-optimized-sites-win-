Each year, more and more shoppers are choosing to make their Black Friday purchases online. What became very clear this year is that many of those purchases are not just being made online, but on mobile devices like smartphone and tablets. According to the latest stats, mobile shopping is bigger than ever.
According to Branding Brand, a mobile commerce platform for sites including Costco and Ralph Lauren, Black Friday sales on smartphone-optimized websites were up 187 percent this year . Not only that, but page views and order values increased as well. Here’s a quick breakdown:
Visits increased 75.65 percent
Page views increased 88.32 percent
Average order value increased 22.08 percent
Mobile sales increased 186.54 percent
According to Branding Brand, this sharp uptick is thanks primarily to iOS devices, which accounted for a much larger percentage of site traffic than Android, as you can see below (based on data from 152 smartphone-optimized sites):
9,319,715 visitors (66.62 percent iOS; 32.97 percent Android)
60,992,791 page views (65.86 percent iOS; 33.67 percent Android)
174,111 orders (70.59 percent iOS; 29.15 percent Android)
$93.20 average order value ($94.18 iOS; $90.88 Android)
If that weren’t enough to illustrate the increasing importance that mobile devices are playing in holiday shopping, here’s another figure. On Thanksgiving day itself, sales on smartphone-optimized websites were up 258 percent .
IBM reported record-setting numbers as well, and broke down some of the details in its IBM Digital Analytics Benchmark . According to the report:
Mobile traffic grew to 39.7 percent of all online traffic, an increase of 34 percent over Black Friday 2012. Mobile sales were also strong, reaching 21.8 percent of total online sales, an increase of nearly 43 percent year-over-year.
Smartphones drove 24.9 percent of all online traffic on Black Friday compared to tablets at 14.2 percent, making it the browsing device of choice. Tablets drove 14.4 percent of all online sales, double that of smartphones, which accounted for 7.2 percent of all online sales. On average, tablet users spent $132.75 per order compared to smartphone users who spent $115.63, a difference of 15 percent.
There are plenty of other studies out there, but the message is almost universally clear: More and more people are shopping online, on mobile devices. So if they haven’t already, online retailers would be wise to provided mobile-optimized sites for potential customers, and fast. It’s also enough to make you wonder that, with so many people doing their Black Friday shopping online, is Cyber Monday still relevant?
