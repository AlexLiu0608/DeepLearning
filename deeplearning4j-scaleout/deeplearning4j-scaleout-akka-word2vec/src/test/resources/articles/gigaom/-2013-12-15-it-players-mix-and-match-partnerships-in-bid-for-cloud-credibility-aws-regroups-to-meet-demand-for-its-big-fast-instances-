Legacy IT powers get partner religion in hopes of boosting cloud cred
Cloud computing must be getting mature — most of the big news last week revolved around IT vendors forming alliances with each other and with hosting companies, telcos and other parties that can help them propagate their cloud, um, stuff.
Cases in point:
HP along with its OpenStack- private cloud,  unveiled partnerships  with that will allow it to “burst up” into public clouds including Windows Azure as well as clouds run by  ARSYS  in Spain and  SFR  in France. It’s clear that U.S. cloud players that want a presence outside the US to allay data sovereignty concerns after NSA gate are rushing to glom onto local companies.
Dell also trotted out a  slew of partnerships  – with CenturyLink (which has been  extremely active of late ); Google, Microsoft Azure, Peer1 Hosting and Red Hat. Those partnerships add to existing alliances with Joyent, ScaleMetrix and Zerolag.
Microsoft which cooperates/competes with Dell  announced alliances  with some 25 telcos, hosting providers around the world – OVH.com, T-Systems, Fujitsu, iWeb, Dimension Data, CSC, and Capgemini.
It bears mentioning that a lot of vendor alliances don’t mount up to much more than a stack of press releases, so take all of this with a grain of salt.
Amazon can’t keep up with C3 demand
Amazon prides itself on metrics and ability to size demand for all the AWS features and functions it rolls out. But apparently it wa s blind-sided by demand for the new C3 SSD-backed instances announced at AWS re:Invent last month. On Friday the company’s blogger-in-chief wrote that ”we have enlarged, accelerated, and expedited our orders for additional capacity across all Regions.  We are working non-stop to get it in-house, and hope to be back to more normal levels of capacity in the next couple of weeks.”
So new C3 instances are coming but unclear when. Also on Friday, AWS said it was  upping the frequency of Cloudwatch EC2 status checks  from once every five minutes to once a minute.
