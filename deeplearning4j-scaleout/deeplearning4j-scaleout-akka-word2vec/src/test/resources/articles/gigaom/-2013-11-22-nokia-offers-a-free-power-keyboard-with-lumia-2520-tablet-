Nokia’s $499 Lumia 2520  tablet is priced $50 higher than Microsoft’s own Surface 2 , mainly because it comes with an integrated LTE radio. Neither come with a keyboard at that price, but for a limited time, Nokia is providing a free Power Keyboard with its tablet. The normally priced $149 keyboard cover has a battery inside, which adds five hours of run-time to the tablet. The offer ends on December 2, and you’ll have to send this form in by January 31 to receive the Power Keyboard in the mail .
