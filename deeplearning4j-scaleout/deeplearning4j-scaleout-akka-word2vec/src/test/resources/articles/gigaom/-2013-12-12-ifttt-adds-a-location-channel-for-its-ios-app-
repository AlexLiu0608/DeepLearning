Good news for the iPhone-toting If This Then That lovers out there. The service has added a native iOS location tracking channel , which means you can make recipes based on where you are (or rather where your phone is). So you can get the weather of a city you are traveling to when you land, or tell your WeMo, Hue or SmartThings-enabled lights to come on when you get home. IFTTT also has a FourSquare channel for those who might want to use location but don’t have an iPhone. It’s just a wee bit less automated.
