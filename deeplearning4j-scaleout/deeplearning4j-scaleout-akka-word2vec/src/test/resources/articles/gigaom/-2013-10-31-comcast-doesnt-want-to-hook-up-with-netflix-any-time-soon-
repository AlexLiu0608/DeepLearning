Comcast only cares about getting people to use their service by bundling them into things they don’t want, then doubling the price after they have you in. Nothing to do with customer satisfaction, or giving the people what they want.
I am glad netflix won’t be on Comcast. It would take 7 to 8 steps to see your content like their current “onDemand” which is AWFUL! Then they started to prevent the ability to Fast forward commercial on some show! WTFreak is that about?
Their equipment is alos junk. I’m on my double digits in cable boxes because their boxes keep failing. Nevermind they are power hungry beasts, they fail every three months or sooner.
I want Netflix and Comcast to stay away from each other. It is the best thing for Netflix.
