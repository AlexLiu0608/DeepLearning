Today marks the end of Winamp, one of the oldest and most important pieces of software in the history of digital music.
To honour the engineering skill and passion that goes into building wonderful software that millions of people enjoy we would like to share a small tribute to honour the great legacy of Winamp.  
Spotiamp is a fully functional music player where you can login using your Spotify Premium account and stream music. We hope this will give you some nice memories of the days before Spotify!
Thank you Winamp – you really whipped the llama’s ass!
