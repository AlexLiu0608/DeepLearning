Peek is taking its activity booking service to the iPhone, offering users the ability to see nearby trips, meals and activities. The app, called Peek Tours and Activities, offers users a personality quiz to narrow down activities that suit their tastes. Users can also browse all offerings directly by “personality,” subject and an area’s point of interest. The app, of course, works best in an area that is a popular for tourists, so scanning for things to do in a small town may not provide a gratifying experience. But, its curated resources are worth considering while on vacation.
