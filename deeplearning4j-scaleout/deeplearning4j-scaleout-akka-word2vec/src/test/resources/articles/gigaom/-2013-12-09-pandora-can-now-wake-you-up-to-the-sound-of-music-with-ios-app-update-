Tired of waking up to the same, grating default alarm on your iPhone every day? Pandora’s latest update is designed to make your mornings much more pleasant, letting you set an alarm and wake up to sounds of the station of your choice.
And if you’re not ready to get up just yet, the app has a programmable snooze function that allows you to decide how long you want to wait between alarms after hitting snooze button. There’s also a sleep timer that allows you to fall asleep while listening to music, which will shut off automatically in 15, 30 or 60 minutes.
Aside from that, the app features a refreshed design for iOS 7, along with some small improvements and bug fixes.
Android users looking for similar functionality will have to wait a bit longer. Pandora said that it is working on alarm for its Android app , but didn’t say when to expect an update.
