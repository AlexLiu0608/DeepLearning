Sprint’s new faster Spark network may be out of reach to most Americans, but it is starting to get more support from handset makers. Sprint said it would start selling a Spark-enabled version of the Samsung Galaxy S 4 in the next few weeks, which can tap into the faster network speeds of its new tri-band LTE network . Unless you live in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Tampa or Miami you won’t see those improved speeds , and Sprint is taking it’s time rolling the upgrade out to the rest of the country. The S 4 joins the HTC One Max, Galaxy Mega and S 4 mini on the Spark roster. They’ll be joined by the LG G2 next year.
