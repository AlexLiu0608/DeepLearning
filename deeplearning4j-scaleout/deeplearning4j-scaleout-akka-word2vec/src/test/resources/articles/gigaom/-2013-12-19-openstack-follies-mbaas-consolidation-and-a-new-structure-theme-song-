Summary:
This week we dish on the latest in the OpenStack soap opera and further convergence in mobile development platforms. If software is eating the world, is mobile eating software?
If you enjoy following the ongoing OpenStack soap opera, we hash out the big news that Salesforce.com will/won’t/may use OpenStack  in this week’s Structure Show.
Also in this pre-holiday grab bag, Derrick Harris and I touch on such other hot topics as:
PayPal’s purchase of Stackmob , another sign of consolidation in the (jargon alert) Mobile-backend-as-a-Service (MbaaS) market, and proof that while software may be eating the world, mobile is eating software;
IBM’s annual selection of  5 hot technologies to watch ;
The prolonged Microsoft CEO search  and whether Ford CEO Alan Mulally  is still in the hunt;
And why we can’t wait for our upcoming Structure Data show . (Hint: there will be more cocktails.)
