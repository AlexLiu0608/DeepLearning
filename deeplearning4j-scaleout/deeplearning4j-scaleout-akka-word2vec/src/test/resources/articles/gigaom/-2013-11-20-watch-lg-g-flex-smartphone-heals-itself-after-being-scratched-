The LG G Flex features a curved screen, but that isn’t even the weirdest thing about it. More interesting, I’d argue, is LG’s “self-healing” coating that actually clears up scratches and other damage made to the case. LG has already released a promotional video of the material in action, but how well does it work in a real world situation? You can see in the video below:
YouTube personality Marques Brownlee got his hands on the phone, and put it through a couple of tests to see whether comparing it to the X-Men’s self-healing Wolverine was genuinely accurate, or just really bizarre marketing. Turns out it’s a bit of both.
First Brownlee pulls out a set of keys and scratches the back of the phone, which is something pretty likely to happen at some point in either your pocket or your bag. And surprisingly, the G Flex is able to heal itself after being inflicted with some light marks. It takes a little bit of time, and the scratches don’t completely disappear, but it looks a heck of a lot better than your standard damage.
Next up Brownlee takes a knife to the back of the phone, which is far less likely to happen in the real world. He runs the knife across the back cover, leaving a deeper scratch. After a few hours, the scratch has healed about halfway, which again, is a much better result than you’re likely to see on any other device.
According to Brownlee, the coating LG uses on the phone works better in a warm environment, which is why it worked so well in LG’s promotional video. He demonstrates that the phone’s healing properties work better with the warmth of his hand, which is pretty impressive.
I’m not so sure whether curved smartphones are ever really going to take off. But self-healing phones? After watching this video, that’s a trend I can get behind.
