MIT Media Lab researchers have come up with a camera that they say can make better medical images and help us avoid car crashes. The $500 “nanocamera” builds on “Time of Flight” technology that calculates object location by how long it takes a light signal to reflect off a surface and return. What the MIT researchers  brought to the table is a way to prevent rain or fog from affecting camera performance, said MIT grad student Achuta Kadambi. And that could really help in the aforementioned collision-avoidance scenario.
