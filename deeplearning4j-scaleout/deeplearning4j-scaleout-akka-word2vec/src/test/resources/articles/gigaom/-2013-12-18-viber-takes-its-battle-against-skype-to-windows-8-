Summary:
The messaging service is now tightly integrated with Microsoft’s PC-slash-tablet OS, although the recently-launched Viber Out feature doesn’t appear to be included.
Earlier this year, the Cyprus-based mobile messaging firm Viber became a full-blown Skype competitor by releasing a comprehensive desktop app. A version of that app is now available for Windows 8.
Viber for Windows 8 takes advantage of several of the platform’s features. It presents a “live tile”, it can snap to the side of the screen, the search charm works for contacts, and the app – even specific conversations – can be pinned to the Start screen. Of course, users can also exchange stickers and locations as usual.
Although Windows 8′s prospects are up for debate, it’s a smart move for Viber to get in there in such an integrated fashion, particularly as Microsoft’s rival Skype service is itself now so integrated with the operating system .
However, according to BGR.in , the Viber Out feature that launched about a week ago — allowing users to call normal phones for a fee – is not part of this release.
