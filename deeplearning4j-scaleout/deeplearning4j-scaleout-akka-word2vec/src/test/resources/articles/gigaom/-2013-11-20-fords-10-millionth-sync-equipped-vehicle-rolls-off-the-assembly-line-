Ford revealed today that it has hit a critical milestone in the connected car world: the automaker has produced 10 million Sync-equipped vehicles since launching the technology just six years ago. Calling every Sync vehicle connected is a bit of stretch, since in its most basic form it’s essentially a voice command and control system. But Ford has been adding features to Sync over the years,  allowing it to integrate with apps on those smartphones . Sync is also becoming standard across most of Ford’s vehicle lines. Since January of 2012 , Sync has arrived in 6 million cars.
