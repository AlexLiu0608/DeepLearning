The 60 Minutes’ report on the NSA last night ( available here ) promised a hard-hitting look, but many called it a “puff piece,” according to a Storify of reactions from journalists built by Circa’s Anthony De Rosa. Of course, Glenn Greenwald chimed in,  wondering why reporter John Miller didn’t ask about how Gen. Keith Alexander “routinely lied to Congress & FISA courts.” Miller said in a CBS piece that he “asked the hardest questions we could ask,” but his discrediting of Snowden as a “20-something-year-old high school dropout” doesn’t do well to assuage accusations of bending to the NSA’s will.
