Al Jazeera’s AJ+ just published a first few videos on YouTube, giving us a first look at the online-only network’s take on news.
Al Jazeera’s new online video venture AJ+ is not set to launch till next year, but the team behind it just published a few videos on YouTube that show how AJ+ will try to distinguish itself from other news publishers online.
