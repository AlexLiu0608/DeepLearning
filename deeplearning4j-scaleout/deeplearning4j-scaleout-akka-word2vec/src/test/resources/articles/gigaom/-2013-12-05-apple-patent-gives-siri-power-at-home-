For Apple product users, the home may soon be Siri’s domain. Apple Insider reports that Cupertino has filed a patent with the USPTO for a “smart dock” that, when plugged in, continually listens for audio cues throughout the house. It’s a much more function-rich version of docks currently available now, but with easily accessible voice control options that allow users to execute commands via voice prompts. The concept seems like a practical step for Apple to get the most use from Siri, while tackling smart home technology.
