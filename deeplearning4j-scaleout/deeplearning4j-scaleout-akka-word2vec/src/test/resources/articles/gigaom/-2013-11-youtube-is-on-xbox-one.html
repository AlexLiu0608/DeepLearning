Posted: Wednesday, November 20, 2013
Love YouTube? Love Xbox? You can now watch your favorite videos and channels with the YouTube app for Xbox One. Check out videos in 1080p glory ( Slip and Slide LAUNCH RAMP anyone?), catch the latest videos from your subscriptions like Polaris , or see trending videos from categories like Music and Sports .
The YouTube app for Xbox One also makes it easier to find and watch whatever you want:
Voice - Control the app just by saying "YouTube" wherever you are in the app. Commands like play, pause, and fast forward will instantly pop up on screen.
Gesture - Grab the screen to scroll through videos, and use your hand to pick which one you want to watch.
