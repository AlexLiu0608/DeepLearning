U.K.-based network operator EE announced one of many expected roaming partnerships on Monday with the first being with AT&T. The carrier bills itself as the biggest and fastest in the U.K and says AT&T customers from the U.S. can expect average speeds of 24 to 30 Mbps in major cities. This freedom isn’t expected to come free, or even cheap though,  says ZDNet. Last week AT&T announced a similar deal with Canada’s Rogers Communications with international data plans for roaming starting at $30 for a measly 120 MB per month.
