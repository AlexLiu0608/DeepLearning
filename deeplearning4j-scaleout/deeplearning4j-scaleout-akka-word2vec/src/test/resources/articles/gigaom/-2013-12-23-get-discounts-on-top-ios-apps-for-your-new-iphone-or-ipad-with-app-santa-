One of the best parts about a brand new iPhone or iPad is that it’s essentially a blank slate. And what better way to make it your own than to start filling it up with apps? If you’re getting a new iOS device for Christmas, or just poking around for some new apps, you might want to check out App Santa , which highlights some major discounts on a number of useful apps.
The site is a collaboration among a number of indie developers that have gotten together to draw attention to some holiday deals on their apps. Most of what you’ll find here is productivity-focused – there’s a scientific calculator, a PDF converter and a remote desktop app, among others – and everything is up to 60 percent off the regular price.
You don’t actually need to visit the site in order to get the deals. All of the apps listed are currently on sale in App Store. The site is just a useful portal to see the available discount offers. And you’ll still have time to score some discounts after Christmas, as the sale prices are good through December 27.
