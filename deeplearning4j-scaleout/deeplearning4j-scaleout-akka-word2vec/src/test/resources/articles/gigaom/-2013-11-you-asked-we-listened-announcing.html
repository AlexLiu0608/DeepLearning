You Asked, We Listened: Announcing Changes to Our Developer Edition Program
At Motorola, we’re focused on delivering the best Android experiences and the best of Google services.  Over this past year, we’ve worked very hard to create ways for users to express themselves using their mobile devices. Customers who purchase Developer Edition devices want the flexibility to take this even further and tinker with the operating system.  This may include creating and flashing a custom build of Android or porting one from an enthusiast community.  Up until now, when a customer requested a bootloader unlock code we would void the warranty for that Developer Edition device.
We are excited to support the developer and enthusiast communities by making two key changes to the Developer Edition program:
Requesting an unlock code will no longer void the device’s warranty
We will start posting return-to-factory software images
For customers who have previously purchased a 2012 or 2013 Developer Edition device directly from Motorola and who have requested a bootloader unlock code, we will reinstate the warranty effective from the date of original purchase.  (You’ll recognize these models because they come with a printed “Developer Edition” across the back and include the Moto X DE (for GSM networks) , Moto X DE (for Verizon) , and Droid Maxx DE (Verizon) .)
In addition, recovery images (as shipped from the factory) will be posted here .  A developer or enthusiast can use this image to restore their device to run with its original factory software.
We hope that you like these changes. Keep telling us what you think (you can use the comments section below or participate in one of the many G+ forums such as Moto X ).
We strongly believe in the developer and enthusiast communities and intend to keep making changes to better support them.
