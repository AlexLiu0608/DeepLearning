Summary:
Everything you need to to know about the updates to Bluetooth as it relates to the internet of things, plus a few gifts for those far more fortunate await you on this week’s podcast.
Whats on your Christmas list this year? Maybe some hue lights or a connected doorbell ? For the extremely rich even this Sony 85-inch television might not be enough. I’ve chatted with Eric Thies, VIA International’s Founder & Director of Marketing to discuss what’s on the list of people with bank statements that rival the GDP of a small country to learn that a 210-inch folding television designed by Porsche or a digital backsplash are what’s on their lists.
But before we do the podcast’s version of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, my colleague Kevin Tofel and I focus on the ever-growing power of Bluetooth for the internet of things, and how a growing number of connected devices are hoping to use Bluetooth as a protocol. We also talk about whether we need remotes for the smart home or if the smartphone is good enough.
