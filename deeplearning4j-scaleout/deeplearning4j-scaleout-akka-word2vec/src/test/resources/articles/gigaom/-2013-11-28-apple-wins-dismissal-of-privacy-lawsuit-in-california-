A federal judge has thrown out a consumer lawsuit against Apple, which alleged that the gadget-maker betrayed the trust of iPhone and iPad owners by allowing apps to scoop up their data and track them without consent. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh axed the 3-year-old case because none of the plaintiffs could prove they relied on Apple’s privacy policy in the first place. Indeed, as she pointed out , none of them could prove they had even read it – and that’s interesting from a legal perspective, because she rejected the ticking of the “Agree” box on iTunes accounts as evidence of genuinely informed consent.
