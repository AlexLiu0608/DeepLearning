Summary:
Users are now able to launch music and movie streams from the web, just like has been possible with YouTube and Netflix since Chromecast launched.
Google Play Music and Google Play Movies just got a bit more tightly integrated with Chromecast : Users of Google’s TV dongle can now launch music and video streams straight from the websites of the two services, thanks to native support for Google’s streaming stick that was rolled out Thursday afternoon. Previously, native casting was only available through both service’s mobile apps.
The new experience is very similar to the way Chromecast integrates with Netflix and YouTube, where users can fling a video to their Chromecast-equipped TV set simply by pressing the cast button within the video player, provided they have Chrome and the Google Cast extension installed. Here’s a screenshot of how the cast button looks like on Google Play Music:
Chromecast got a big update earlier this week , with ten new third-apps coming to the platform. Google hasn’t said when it will bring Chromecast support to additional Google apps, but the company has been experimenting with cast support for a variety of its services.
A few months ago, users briefly were able to cast YouTube videos embedded on third-party websites , and some users have reported that they’ve been able to cast presentations natively from Google Drive . And also this week, Google released a Santa Tracker app with Chromecast support.
