Summary:
E Ink Holdings had a scare earlier this year as sales of ebook readers using its screen technology fell. There are other uses for E Ink screens though: Consider this large tablet used to view Autocad drawings.
Growing up, I was surrounded by blueprints and design drawings thanks to my father’s career as an architect. I remember as he got older, he started playing around with computer-aided design, or CAD, programs. Were he still around today, I think he’d be mesmerized by the new PocketBook CAD Reader.
The 13.3-inch Android tablet uses the latest E Ink Fina display which has less than half the weight of a similar glass-based TFT and is less than half as thick as well. The PocketBook CAD Reader has a 1 GHz dual-core chip and runs Android 4.0.4 with 2 GB of memory and 16 GB of internal storage. It also has an 8,000 mAh battery, Wi-Fi and an integrated 3G radio as well as Wacom digitizer support.
Obviously, this device was built with a very clear purpose in mind; it’s specifically designed to render Autocad drawing files.
That purpose is best suited, however, for a high-contrast grayscale display and it’s nice to see E Ink products made available for markets outside of the obvious ones — think ebook readers. That’s important because this past August, E Ink Holdings reported its worst quarter in four years as traditional tablets gobbled up ebook reader sales. There’s still plenty of opportunity for E Ink displays in future products as the PocketBook CAD Reader shows, so don’t write off E Ink just yet.
