BBM Channels, the new social feed-based component of BlackBerry Messenger, will open up to all BlackBerry users with a handset running BB5 or higher today. The app has been available through BlackBerry’s Beta Zone since May, but finally appears ready to make a more official debut.
BBM Channels lets you follow different brands and businesses. You can comment on, like and share updates posted to the channel. Or you can engage in a private chat session with the owner or manager of the page. Channel owners can share updates, post images and GIFs and start discussions with subscribers.
BlackBerry’s page with the announcement no longer appears to be up, but a BlackBerry spokesperson told The Next Web that BBM Channels will go live at 12PM PT , and that the feature will be added to the new BBM app for Android and iOS “in the coming months.”
