Summary:
The week in cloud: Jared Wray, newly installed cloud CTO of CenturyLink talks about how Tier 3, AppFog, Savvis fit in the CenturyLink cloud umbrella; and we give thanks for special blessings.
Jared Wray, CTO of cloud for CenturyLink.
This week we wonder what’s up with Joyent and a few other privately-held cloud companies. Must they get bought or go the way of the do-do bird?
Our guest Jared Wray, formerly CTO of Tier 3, has a theory on this. As a cloud provider, he noted, you really need to find your niche and capitalize on it (as he said Virtustream or Tier 3 do) or get really, (REALLY) big via M&A. Or go away. Of course his company just got acquired by CenturyLink , so there’s that.
On the flip side, as I have to keep reminding myself, we’re still very, very early in cloud so maybe the pie really is big enough for all.
But to kick things off, Derrick Harris and I — neither particularly known for our magnanimity — give thanks for the companies and personalities that make our jobs fun.
