The PlayStation 4 has only been in out in the U.S. and Canada for less than a week (and done gangbusters in that short time), but Sony  is already sweetening the deal for U.K. customers with a bundle pack offering both the next-gen console and a PS Vita, according to IGN . While the advertisement IGN points to does not have any price listed, there’s no doubt that it’ll be of significant value, especially when considering the Vita’s remote play capabilities with the PS4. There’s no word on whether a bundle like this will be available Stateside for the holidays, but it could be a game-changer for Sony.
