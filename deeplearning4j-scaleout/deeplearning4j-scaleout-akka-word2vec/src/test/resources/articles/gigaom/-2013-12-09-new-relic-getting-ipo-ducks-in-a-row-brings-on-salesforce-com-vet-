Summary:
Hilarie Koplow-McAdams brings enterprise sales credibility with her into New Relic which seeks to entrench its APM tools in companies ranging from startups to the biggest of big companies.
New Relic just named  Hilarie Koplow McAdams as its first chief revenue officer in what’s seen as  pre-IPO prep . Koplow-McAdams was most recently vice president of global sales for Salesforce.com and also spent time in executive roles at Intuit and Oracle.
In a blog post announcing the hire, New Relic founder and CEO Lew Cirne said she will direct the development of “New Relic sales, customer success services and business development organizations — focused on growth across all market sizes, segments and key geographies.”
The goal is to entrench New Relic, a Software-as-a-Service-based application performance management and monitoring tool, in companies ranging from startups to mega-enterprises. The company is also trying to broaden out, seeking to capitalize on all  the data it collects in monitoring all those applications.
San Francisco-based New Relic is expected to file an IPO in 2014.
