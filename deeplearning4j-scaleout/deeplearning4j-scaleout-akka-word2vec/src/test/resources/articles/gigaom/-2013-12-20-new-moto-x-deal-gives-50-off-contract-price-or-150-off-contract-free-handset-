Summary:
In case you missed it the first couple of times, Motorola is offering another deal on the Moto X.

Motorola has already given buyers plenty of opportunities to snag a new Moto X on the cheap, but those deals came and went pretty quickly . But now a new deal is here, and it’s pretty good: You can get 50 percent off of the contract price of a Moto X on AT&T, Sprint or Verizon, or you can take $150 off the price of a contract-free handset.
There’s a couple of caveats: The deal isn’t good for the developer edition of the phone, and it also doesn’t apply to the new bamboo version . On the plus side, it does give you 50 percent off a number of different accessories as well.
To get the deal, just head over to this sign-up page  and use the registration code todayshow50. Choose the promo you want, and you’ll be sent a code which you can then enter when buying a phone through Moto Maker .
You might want to jump on this fast, though, because it’s unclear how long the deal will last.
