It looks like Logitech and Moga will soon have some more company in the iPhone gaming department. According to noted tipster @evleaks , Razer is looking to get in on the action with the Razer Kazuyo iPhone controller.
As you can see from the images here, the controller looks a lot like the Logitech PowerShell, with one key difference: It appears that the case offers the ability to tilt your iPhone outwards, which could offer an enhanced perspective while gaming. Other than that, there’s a D-pad and four action action keys, just like the PowerShell. And according to The Verge, there’s also a pair of shoulder buttons . The controls are reported to be pressure sensitive, and the action buttons backlit. Those features should set it apart from the competition nicely.
There’s no information on availability or pricing, but I’d expect the Kazuyo to arrive at a price similar to the $100 you’ll pay for a controller from Logitech or Moga. And I imagine it’ll work with most of the same devices as well: the iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, iPhone 5s and the fifth-generation iPod touch.
