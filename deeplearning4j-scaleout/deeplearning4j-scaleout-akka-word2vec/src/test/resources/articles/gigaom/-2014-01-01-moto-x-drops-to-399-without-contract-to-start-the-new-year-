In a move that should spur sales, Motorola started 2014 by dropping the cost of its Moto X handset to $399 without a contract . The deal was announced on Wednesday morning and applies to all carriers as well as Moto Maker custom phones. While some thought the Android phone was overpriced at launch for the hardware that it offered, I think the experience and features make up for any lacking components . Regardless, the issue of cost is less of one now that the new year has started with a price reduction for the Moto X.
