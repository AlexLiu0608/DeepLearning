Good news for everyone lining up to get an Xbox One: Microsoft’s new game console will have a YouTube app available at launch, after all. YouTube announced the app on its blog Wednesday , explaining that it will make use of both voice and gesture control, and showing that it’s otherwise pretty much the same as any other recent connected  TV app implementations of YouTube. Earlier this week, it briefly looked like neither the Xbox One nor Sony’s PS4 would have a YouTube app at launch, but it appears that Microsoft got the job done just in time. In other words: Sony, the ball is in your court.
