It’s a good time for high-valuation tech companies — but it’s a better time to have a really high valuation. This and other insights come from research firm CB Insights’  2014 Tech IPO Pipeline Report . Expected to be released today, the report analyzes private tech companies with a valuation over $100 million, as well as the behaviors of their investors. Of the 472 companies that CB Insights included in the 2013 pipeline last year, 48 percent exited or received financing this year. This upcoming year, there are 590 companies that CB insights sees as in the running for IPOs. Here’s a look at the report to get a better sense of how those will do.
While the number of deals remained the same for 2014 companies, the average investment jumped 19 percent while the median dropped slightly from last year. This is due to an increase in companies with estimated valuations of $1 billion or more.
In total, 25 companies, including Jawbone , Snapchat  and Square , reached the billion-dollar valuation bar for 2014 pipeline companies. Such companies saw a growth of 67 percent from 2012 to 2013.
Of venture firms investing in these private tech companies, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers  has the most in its portfolio. The report also breaks down their investments by stages (KPCB most often invested in Series B and Series C companies).
Internet companies make up over half of the 2014 pipeline companies, a growth of 39 percent since last year.
As far as locations for these companies, California remains in the lead with 308 companies. New York, however, saw the most growth with a 50 percent increase in pipeline companies since last year.
