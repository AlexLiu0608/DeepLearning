Summary:
Wouldn’t it be cool to use any handset to control your TV or to share media around your home? A deal to put Qualcomm’s AllJoyn protocol on LG Smart TVs brings that reality closer.
LG, the Korean appliance vendor will support Qualcomm’s AllJoyn protocol in its smart televisions coming out next year. This is a big deal because it’s a vote in favor of Qualcomm’s AllJoyn protocol that seeks to create a smart layer to connect and control devices regardless of their radio protocol, but also because a big TV vendor is ceding to the viewpoint that the overall connected home ecosystem is more important than an individual company OS.
For consumers this means a bit less until AllJoyn is more widespread. But eventually it could mean that your mobile devices–regardless of device or OS could be used as a controller to play a game on your TV or to share content on the TV.
All 2014 LG Smart TV models will come preloaded with AllJoyn and 2013 and 2012 will be upgraded to support it over time. The details on that timing are unclear however.
LG’s smart TV efforts have been varied. The company has its own operating system for smart TVs, it has a partnership with Google to sell Google TV and it also purchased the Palm WebOS assets from HP this year for use in its televisions. The decision to choose AllJoyn could be an admission that an ecosystem is the right step for building a truly integrated home platform or it could just be a sign of flailing.
However, using AllJoyn, a protocol that Qualcomm has built to help share content between and control a variety of connected devices, could allow LG to offer a TV platform that will let consumers share online content on their televisions without those content providers having to write their apps for every different connected widget out there.
That’s the hope anyhow. Today AllJoyn has been used to show off media sharing and little else. But Rob Chandhok, president of Qualcomm’s Interactive Platforms division, says next year we should see some more interesting use cases. For example when your mobile phone rings, the caller ID could show up on an AllJoyn enabled TV. Likewise a smart watch (say Qualcomm’s Toq) using AllJoyn could eventually control other devices running the protocol.
