Mars One
Meet the thousands of people ready to die on Mars
For $40, those who couldn't be astronauts see Mars One as their chance.
The timeline for Mars One , the space exploration program intended to  send humans on a one-way trip to Mars that has earned a fair share of dubious looks and sideways glances  from the technology and science community, has been pushed back two years as of Tuesday. The company announced the new timeline as well as commissions for both Lockheed Martin and Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. to develop “mission concept studies” for the expedition.
Lockheed Martin is at work on Mars One’s lander, which will be designed after NASA’s Phoenix mission lander, another Lockheed Martin project. The Phoenix spacecraft touched down in May 2008, completed all planned experiments by November 2008, and then lost contact with Earth.
Mars One’s lander will be able to scoop soil, just like the Phoenix craft. In addition, Mars One notes that “a water experiment will extract water from the Martian soil.” The press release does not elaborate further how this will be accomplished, though evidence suggests water was once on Mars . The team could be referring to the extraction process done by NASA's Curiosity rover.
The SSTL-manufactured satellite will demonstrate a “high bandwidth communications system” that will sit in a Mars synchronous orbit and relay the video feed that would ultimately show the people of earth what the Mars One crew is doing at all times.
In the same press release, Mars One declares that it has decided to launch the lander and satellite two years later than originally anticipated, in 2018. This pushes the crew’s touchdown back to 2025 rather than 2023.
As of the end of October, Mars One has raised $183,870 toward its mission and has yet to release a budget for its program. For comparison, NASA anticipates launching another Mars rover in 2020 at a total cost of $1.5 billion.
