Summary:
By analyzing large and complex sets of medical data, Lockheed Martin is finding ways to identify health trends, detect disease, predict medical complications and ultimately deliver more comprehensive and affordable care. Genomics may be the key to this very personalized and predictive medical future.
Each one of us carries a unique genome, composed of DNA, genetic mapping, hereditary information and biological characteristics. In other words, we are made up of millions of individual data points.
By studying this data, sequencing enough genomes and analyzing enough scenarios, doctors will be able to understand and predict how unique people will react to specific treatments and determine susceptibility to certain diseases.
“The ability to match treatment — and even prevention — to a person’s genetics is the promise of this exciting science.” said Michael Hultner, the chief scientist for Lockheed Martin’s Health & Life Sciences group.
After honing its big data skills in the aerospace and defense market for decades, Lockheed Martin now sees applications in areas like medical analytics . In one example, Lockheed Martin applied its signal processing and data analytics expertise to help improve sepsis detection. Sepsis is caused when chemicals deployed by the body to fight infection inadvertently cause inflammation, and it can lead to organ failure and even death.
Using patients’ vital signs, lab reports and other indicating features, Lockheed Martin developed a predictive formula that detects sepsis 14 to 16 hours earlier than current methods and with 19 percent more reliability for positive tests and 76 percent more reliability for patients testing negative.
“Lockheed Martin has the expertise to organize, analyze, and partner with the scientific community to understand this data and facilitate the next breakthrough in modern medicine and healthcare,” said Brad Pietras, Lockheed Martin’s VP of technology.
