You’ve seen videos, 3D photos, live streaming and footage taken from a drone. But have you ever seen 3D video live streaming from a drone?
The Bublcam is a ball that shoots 3D photos and videos, and its creators at Bubl recently released a video the camera shot while hanging from a drone. It’s pretty cool; as the drone takes flight, you can pan in any direction.

While Bublcam is the first 360-degree camera to incorporate live streaming, its real strength is its price and toughness. Today is the last day to grab one on Kickstarter , where units are available for just less than $500.
Roughly the size of a baseball, the camera shoots 14 megapixel photos and high-definition video. An included app can be used to control factors like zoom and saturation, plus browse galleries of photos and videos.
Unlike the Panono camera , which is a ball that takes 360 degree photos when it is thrown into the air, the Bublcam is better suited to being held or attached to a tripod or helmet. Bubl puts a great deal of focus on the Bublcam’s potential use for extreme sports like skydiving — an area currently dominated by GoPro cameras. The Bublcam doesn’t look quite as tough or water resistant, but at $500 it is definitely a new competitor.
The Kickstarter campaign will be live until 3:37 a.m. PT Saturday. As of 1 p.m. today, it had raised roughly $325,000; well above the original goal of $100,000. Bubl plans to deliver the cameras to backers between February and May of next year.
