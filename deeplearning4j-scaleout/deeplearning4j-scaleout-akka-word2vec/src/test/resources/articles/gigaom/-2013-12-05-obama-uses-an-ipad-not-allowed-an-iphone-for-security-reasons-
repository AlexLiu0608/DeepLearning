Summary:
According to Reuters, Barack Obama still uses a BlackBerry smartphone, though not necessarily by choice.
At the White House Youth Summit on the Affordable Care Act in Washington on Wednesday, U.S. President Barack Obama fielded a number of questions, but not all of them were about health care. While the President turns to an Apple iPad for his tablet needs, he is not allowed to use an iPhone for “security reasons,” according to Reuters .
So while Obama is the first President in office to use email during his presidency, he does so from a BlackBerry smartphone. Although this isn’t a ringing endorsement for the struggling BlackBerry , at the very least it’s an acknowledgment that the U.S. government trusts the company from a security perspective.
