Summary:
BIME, a business intelligence software company, has raised $4 million in first round funding and opened a U.S. headquarters in Kansas City.
BIME, the French data analytics startup, has raised $4 million in a first round funding round led by Alven Capital Partners in Paris. The startup, which was founded in 2009, offers real-time business analytics software that runs on premise or on top of Google’s Big Query database.
The company plans to use the money to expand its operations including building a U.S. headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri. Rachel Delacour, CEO and co-founder of BIME, said that the choice of KC was influenced by Google’s fiber deployment , a lower cost of operations and the availability of talent.
“From Europe it seemed like an interesting hub for tech startups, and we’re not going to Silicon Valley right now,” said Delacour. “Trying to be as sexy as Google or Facebook is tough in Silicon Valley, but there we want to be the big fish to attract people who are as smart as people in the Silicon Valley.”
She added that Google Fiber and the tech startup initiatives that Kansas City is building out around the fiber effort are pretty compelling. For now, BIME has about 70 percent of its revenue coming from outside of France but only one large customers in the U.S. The hope is that will soon change with this funding and the U.S. operations.
As for the company’s business opportunity, Delacour sees a coming shift in how businesses store their data. She points out that most companies now have so many data stores in the cloud, as opposed to in a data warehouse, that only cloud-based business intelligence software makes sense. the company supports pulling data from Google’s Big Query and Salesforce and runs its own operations on Amazon’s and Google’s clouds.
