Summary:
Next week the internet  of things will star at the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas. Ahead of all the hubbub my guest, Chester Pipkin, the CEO of Belkin and I discuss what we’re going to see.
Next week at this time my colleague and co-host Kevin Tofel will be fighting the hordes at the Consumer Electronics Show and reporting back on the cool widgets and gadgets that he finds. But before he takes off, we discussed a bit of what he’s expecting to see, including voice controls for the internet of things, presence awareness and smarter algorithms that will turn the smart home from something people have to program into the anticipatory home, that will react to you.
And because Kevin and I aren’t exactly consumer electronics industry insiders, my guest this week is Chet J. Pipkin, the CEO of Belkin, the maker of the WeMo line of connected devices. Belkin will have a smart home setup at CES (so will SmartThings) and while Pipkin declined to scoop his own company’s news, we discussed the big trends ahead for the smart home. So listen up as you pack and prepare for the internet of things to dominate the conversation at CES.
