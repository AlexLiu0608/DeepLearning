Summary:
Following its task management hit, the folks behind Any.Do have brought Cal to Android. The sleek and simple looking calendar has tight integrations with other apps and makes it easy to manage your day.
Normally, the debut of a new calendar app for Android wouldn’t get me too excited. Seen one, you’ve seen ‘em all, right? Not so with Cal , from the folks that make one of my favorite task management tools, Any.Do . Cal debuted on iOS back in July, and on Wednesday, it launched on Android with some platform-specific goodies.
What I like about Cal is two-fold: A clean, easy-to-use look and deep integration with Any.Do’s task management features. The app is smart too thanks to hooks into other useful applications. Got an appointment on your calendar and need a ride? You can request an Uber car through Cal, for example. And Cal learns about you over time; it can even suggest who you want to meet when setting appointments.
On the surface, these are simple little extras but they’re time savers and exactly the type of things that a smart calendar application should do.
While the new Cal app for Android is just like the iOS version, it gains some additional features through the Android platform. There’s landscape support, real-time synchronization with Exchange or Google Calendar, and a home screen widget to show what tasks or appointments are on your agenda.
When Any.Do arrived on the scene, I had no hesitation in recommending it for Android users and I’m doing the same with Cal. Don’t even add a to-do item for downloading it in the Google Play store ; just go now and give it a try.
