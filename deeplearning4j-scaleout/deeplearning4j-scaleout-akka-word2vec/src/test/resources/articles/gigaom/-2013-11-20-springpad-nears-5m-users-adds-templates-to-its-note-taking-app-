Summary:
Springpad is still tiny compared to Evernote but it’s growing. The company is hoping its new pre-formatted notebooks optimized for specific tasks will give it an additional boost over the holidays.
Springpad’s note-taking service is building up a following as it challenges Evernote’s app in the digital organization realm. VP of business development Jeff Janer told me that it’s coming up on its 5 millionth registered user across its smartphone, tablet and web apps (compared to Evernote’s more than 75 million), and in a bid to gain more traction before the holidays, Springpad is launching specially formatted notebooks optimized for specific tasks.
Springpad originally attracted a lot of type-A personalities, who were content to start with a blank notebook and impose their own organizational philosophies, Janer said. But as the app acquires more users, customers have asked for more organizational templates geared to specific tasks. So Springpad has created several specialty notebook formats, such as holiday meal and event planners and a home organizer folio.
In addition, Springpad is inviting its commercial partners to create their own templates, which incorporate their own organizing principles and their own content. For instance, Clutter-organizing guru Peter Walsh has created a holiday organizer that lays out tasks step-by-step and suggests ideas for putting together a large family gathering. Breville has created a holiday meal planner, which mixes and matches its own recipe content with dishes the notebook user finds on the web.
The initial batch of templates are all holiday themed due to the season, but the company plans on launching many more general-purpose templates, Janer said, and eventually users will be able to create their own templates.
