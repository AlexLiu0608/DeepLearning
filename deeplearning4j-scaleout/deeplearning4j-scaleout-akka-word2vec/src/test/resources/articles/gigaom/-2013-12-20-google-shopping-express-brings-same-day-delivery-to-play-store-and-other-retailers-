Need a Chromecast , fast? Just in time for the holidays, Google has launched Google Shopping Express , a same-day delivery service for products from Google Play and some additional retail partners. I thought about giving it a shot, but right now deliveries are made to the San Francisco Bay Area only.
Google has partnered with a number of retailers – including Costco, Target and Walgreens – to deliver local goods, but you can also order a few devices from Google itself. Right now you can pick from a Chromecast, Nexus 7 or Nexus 10, as well as a few different cases.
If you sign up now, Google is offering six months of unlimited same-day delivery for free. You’ll also get $10 off of your first purchase. There are no deliveries on Christmas day, but you can get same-day packages delivered as late as Christmas Eve. Not a bad deal for lazy Bay Area residents looking to do some last-minute shopping,
