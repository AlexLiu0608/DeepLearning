The Galaxy Note 3 ’s $300 price tag might be a bit hard to swallow, but Samsung is slipping buyers something to help it go down a bit smoother, in the form of $50 in Google Play credit. The offer began on November 5, but you can still claim the credit if you purchased a new Note before that.
Simply head to this site , where you’ll need to enter your phone number, IMEI and a bit of additional information. Samsung will send you a confirmation email with a code you can redeem in Google Play good for $50 in credit – which should be able to buy you plenty of apps, books, movies or music. The promotion lasts until January 6 of next year.
Is Samsung’s latest offer to incentivize slowing phablet sales? Or is it simply one big push for the holidays? No matter the answer, if you already bought or were planning to buy a Galaxy Note 3, you win.
