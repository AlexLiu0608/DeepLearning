Summary:
In its march to support all the relevant cloud platforms, Cloud Munch adds the Cloud Foundry platform-as-a-service to a list that includes AWS and OpenStack IaaS platforms.
CloudMunch, which offers a continuous integration service in the Amazon Web Services and OpenStack realms and via Chef now adds support for the  Cloud Foundry PaaS as well.
With Cloud Foundry in the fold, CloudMunch users can keep using their preferred devops toolchain to deploy to hosted Pivotal.io or on-premise Cloud Foundry, according to the company. Pivotal announced general availability of its commercial PivotalCF last week.
The Seattle-based startup competes with Werker ,  Electric Cloud,   CloudBees,   CircleCI  and  Atlassian Bamboo  continuous integration products as well as Nolio or legacy BMC and IBM products that handle deployment and release automation.
Last spring, CloudMunch CEO Pradeep Prabhu told me that his company’s advantage is that it does all of that — the CI, the deployment and release automation via a SaaS model, freeing up devops to just do their jobs with the toolchain they prefer. They can sign on from their Github account, for example.
Now with Cloud Foundry support, they have another target cloud.
