According to Oppo, its Find 5 was the world’s first smartphone to feature a 5-inch, 1080p display. Now it’s looking to push things even further, jumping straight to the Find 7 and a “2K” display. The OEM took to Twitter on Monday to share a teaser for its upcoming phone, which clearly states the device will feature a 2K display.
Just what is a 2K display, exactly? 2K refers to a display with 2,000 horizontal lines; in this case, a likely resolution of 2560 by 1440 pixels. 1080p, the current high-water mark for smartphone resolution, is for devices with a screen that contains 1920 by 1080 pixels. The Find 7’s screen was initially believed to measure 5.7 inches in size, which would work out to a whopping 515 pixels per inch. But Carl Pei, a former Oppo executive, recently said that the Find 7 won’t feature a 5.7-inch screen, nor will it feature a 7-inch screen, the other oft-rumored number.
Either way, this teaser makes it pretty clear that 2K displays are likely to become the new standard for future high-end smartphones. Samsung, for instance, is rumored to be using a 2K display for the Galaxy S5 .
I’m a little worried about what this can mean for battery life. After all, the higher the screen resolution, the bigger the draw on your battery. On top of that, I wonder if 2K might be overkill? There’s really only a certain amount of pixels our eyes can distinguish. (My colleague Kevin Tofel goes into much greater detail on the dubious benefits of 2K screens  here .) On the other hand, without actually having seen a 2K phone yet, I’m pretty excited for this technology to come to market to see what kind of difference it makes.
