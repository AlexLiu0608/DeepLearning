Before PlayStation 4 launched, some folks predicted that PlayStation 4 and PS Vita would be put together in a bundle. After all, with the advent of Remote Play between the console and handheld, it would make a lot of sense.
Now, we have confirmation that Sony is planning to do just that, at least in the United Kingdom. MCVUK reports that Sony is planning an “Ultimate Bundle” for that region that will give consumers PS4 and Vita in one package.
Meanwhile, VideoGamer.com posted the image below from MCV, showing a Sony advertisement for the bundle.

No pricing information is yet available for the Ultimate Edition bundle in the UK, and it’s unclear if and when it will be released in other territories. In the meantime, we’ve reached out to Sony for comment.
