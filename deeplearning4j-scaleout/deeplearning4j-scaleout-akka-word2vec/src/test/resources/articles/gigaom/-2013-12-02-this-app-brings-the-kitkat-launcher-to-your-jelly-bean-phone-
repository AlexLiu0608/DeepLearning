• Backup and Restore
• Access to App Ops to manage app permissions
You’ve probably noticed that it doesn’t provide quick access to Google Now, or the “OK, Google” voice search feature. But the app is free, and it gives you a good taste of what to expect when KitKat finally comes your way. Not only that, but it gives you the option to hide the Google search bar and change the grid size on your home screen and app drawer, which you can’t do otherwise.
A paid version of the app is also available, which adds backup and restore options to your settings menu. Either way, it weighs in at just 1.3 MB, and is well worth a download for curious Android users.
