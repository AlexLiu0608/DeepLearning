In a short letter to the jailbreak community, the Evasi0n group has announced they are refusing to distribute TaiG , a Chinese app store released alongside an iOS 7.x jailbreak. Users found that the app store contained hundreds of pirated apps.
Evasi0n said they “dropped the ball” and that the TaiG partnership was a mistake.
We terminated our relationship with them. We are very disappointed that they have decided to put up a cracked version of the jailbreak on their site that installs Taig. We did not give them any permission or source code.
They also reverse-engineered the software to assess how TaiG handled user privacy, finding that the software sent no private data and that the software sent unique identifiers in encrypted form. Noted home-brew app developer Jay Freeman confirmed that Evasi0n was to receive at least $1 million from TaiG, although the actual sum was not disclosed.
The group has also announced that they are not accepting cash from TaiG:
There have been a lot of rumors listing various amounts we’ve been paid. We have received no monies from any group, including Taig. We will not be accepting any money. Our donations are being given to Public Knowledge, Electronic Frontier Foundation and Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure to help protect jailbreaking as your legal right.
