LG-V510 is a Google Play Edition LG G Pad 8.3, Not a New Nexus
The mystery of the LG-V510 is pretty close to being solved today, as open source files for the tablet have surfaced over at LG’s site. If you download the source .zip file and unzip it, you are greeted with three files – two of which call it the “G-Pad 8.3 Google Play Edition.” Rumors for weeks have gone round and round about this device, hoping all along that it would be some sort of Nexus 8 . Sorry folks, it isn’t. But, it’s pretty close! 
As you all know, Google Play Edition devices are top tier devices that have shed their manufacturer skins in favor of stock Android that is updated regularly, almost as quickly as a Nexus device. We currently have two GPE devices, the HTC One and Samsung Galaxy S4. Should the G Pad 8.3 join them, it will launch as the first Google Play Edition tablet, if that means anything extra.
Here is a screenshot of the files:
Assuming the G Pad 8.3 will carry the exact same specs that it currently does, you are looking at a 8.3-inch full HD display, Snapdragon 600 processor, 2GB RAM, and a 4600mAh battery.
