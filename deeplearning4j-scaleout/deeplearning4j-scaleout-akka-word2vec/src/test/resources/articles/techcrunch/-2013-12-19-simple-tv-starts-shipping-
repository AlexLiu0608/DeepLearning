Gift Guide: Four Sweet Presents For Your Sweetheart
Simple.TV is making good on its promise to ship its next-generation streaming DVR to users who pre-ordered the product, telling them they would receive the devices by the end of the year. The company is also releasing new versions of its iOS and Android mobile and tablet apps to make it easier for users to find content that they want to stream and record. The release comes ahead of Simple.TV’s plan to unveil a cloud-based DVR storage offering, as well as support on OUYA game consoles.
