Mozilla’s Asm.js Gets Another Step Closer To Native Performance
TechCrunch is about to hit the road again. Starting in late February, we’re bringing the magic of our Pitch-Off events to Atlanta and New Orleans. Then, a month later, we’re hitting Washington D.C., New York City, Boston and The City of Angels, Los Angeles. And that’s just for the first half of the year.
Like previous pitch-offs, tickets will be just $5 and grant you access to an evening of pitching, drinking and general tomfoolery, TechCrunch style. And like before, the events will be a boisterous good time.
These meetups have evolved over time. Once just John Biggs and family touring the East Coast in a rented van, these events are now large productions featuring fun interviews and a pitch-off competition involving the best startups in each city. If you’ve attended a previous TC meetup, you’re going to want to come to 2014′s events, too.
Tickets and venues will be released in the coming weeks.
Our sponsors help make events happen. If you are interested in learning more about sponsorship opportunities, please contact our sponsorship team here sponsors@techcrunch.com.
