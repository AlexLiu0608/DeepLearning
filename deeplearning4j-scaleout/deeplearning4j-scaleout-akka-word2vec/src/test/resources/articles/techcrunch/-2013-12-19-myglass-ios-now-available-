Madefire Partners With DC On Batman: Arkham Origins Interactive Graphic Novel, Digital First Titles
After a brief appearance earlier this week, Google’s official iOS support app for Google Glass has re-entered the App Store. MyGlass for iOS lets users set up their head-mounted computer, screencast their field of view, add new Glassware apps, manage contacts and get directions.
MyGlass originally got pulled when it came out ahead of official support being built into Glass itself. Glass got an update for its firmware, XE 12 , shortly after the original launch of the MyGlass app, which made everything work smoothly and explains why MyGlass has now returned to the App Store.
Essentially MyGlass for iOS does what MyGlass for Android does – but it’s taken Google a bit longer to roll out support for Apple’s mobile devices. Prior to the launch of MyGlass for iOS, users could still pair Glass with an iPhone and use it, but it lacked much of the advanced functionality available on Android, and essentially worked like a very expensive Bluetooth headset.
One interesting difference to note between MyGlass on the App Store and MyGlass on the Google Play Market – Apple’s software storefront seems to do away with some whimsy. Compare the two descriptions of the software from each below to see what I’m talking about:
App Store
If you don’t have Glass, then downloading this will be a waste of time. Sorry about that. Learn more at google.com/glass.
Google Play
If you don’t have Glass, then downloading this will be a waste of time. Sorry about that. But if you swipe the screenshots to the right you’ll see there’s a picture of a puppy in pajamas. So not a total waste of time after all.
