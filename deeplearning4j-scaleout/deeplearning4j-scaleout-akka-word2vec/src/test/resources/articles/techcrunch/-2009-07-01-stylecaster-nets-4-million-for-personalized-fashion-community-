Toshiba launching the TG01 next week in London
Interactive fashion community StyleCaster has raised $4 million in Series A round of financing from investor Dan Gilbert, the chairman and founder of Quicken Loans.
Launched in February 2009, StyleCaster is a platform that hopes to be the future of online fashion. The site features style tips optimized for each individual, news and content on the latest fashion trends, a niche social network based around style, and a large online retail catalog of brand-name clothing. And the site isn’t just geared towards women—StyleCaster will soon include a community around men’s fashion.
The funding will be used to invest in content creation, web-based and mobile applications, and its advertising network. StyleCaster is an interesting take on combining an interactive community with shopping and editorial and styling content. The site blends several different experiences into the fashion-based platform, creating a one-stop-shop for fashionistas.
