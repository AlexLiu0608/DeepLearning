YouTube Finally Lands On The 3DS
With Thanksgiving behind us and Christmas looming on the horizon, Samsung apparently thought it fitting to drop a few pre-holiday gifts in our lap. A number of rumors have been swirling this morning regarding Samsung’s giant Galaxy Note phone line, including upgraded cameras and perhaps a lite version of the phone.
So what’s to expect for the phablet?
Well, to start, it appears that Samsung may be working on a lower-end “lite” model of the Galaxy Note. Unwired View is calling it the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Lite , and it will reportedly be unveiled at MWC next year.
According to SamMobile , the Note 3 Lite (model number SM-N7505) showed up in shipping manifests over the weekend for testing. The variants included a 5.49 and 5.7-inch display of an LCD persuasion, opposed to the more expensive Super AMOLED displays.
The idea here is that the Galaxy Note 3 Lite will be a lower-cost alternative to consumers interested in switching over to Samsung’s flagship lines but not for more than $300.
Meanwhile, other rumors have surfaced claiming that the next Galaxy Note (presumably the Galaxy Note 4) will come with a 20-megapixel camera sensor.
We’re seeing a clear battle in the camera department, with Nokia’s 41-megapixel PureView cameras and even Sony popping a 20-megapixel sensor on the Xperia Z1. However, a megapixel is just a number, which Apple has proven with the iPhone 5s at 8 megapixels.
According to ET News , Samsung has developed the 20-megapixel sensor for release in the second half of 2014. It seems that the Galaxy S5 will come to market a bit early to sport the new 20-megapixel sensor, but the Galaxy Note 4 should be right on time.
As far as confirmed news goes, Samsung today announced new colors for the Galaxy Note 3, including Rose Gold White, Rose Gold Black, and Merlot Red.
