“Hello Santa” Offers A Memorable, But Pricey, Video Call With A Real-Life Santa
Chalk up another casualty in the consolidation of Internet voice services. Nearly four years to the day after getting acquired by Telefonica for $207 million , VoIP provider Jajah has announced that it is shutting down, effective January 31, 2014. Registered users of Jajah.com (its web-based service that provides a price-reducing VoIP bridge between two landline or mobile numbers) and Jajah Direct (which assigns local numbers to international contacts) started to receive notifications of the closure this weekend, with details of  where to apply online for refunds.
We’re embedding a copy of the note below, which is also posted on its website.
The note doesn’t explain why the service is shutting down. We have reached out to Telefonica for more clarification (which we have now recieved, with the update below, noting that while Jajah is closing, the backbone is alive and kicking.)
My guess is that it was probably due to a couple of reasons. The main one is that the service simply was not growing — not in terms of new products, nor new users.
The second one is that Telefonica has been pursuing other ways of using VoIP to pick up more users, namely with mobile apps like Tu Go . That left the consumer-facing part of Jajah more or less neglected and underdeveloped.
Just how ignored was Jajah? Most pages on Jajah’s site now redirect to an announcement of its closure. But if you go to its corporate blog (at least at the time of this writing), it’s still live, and frankly surreal.
The last two months of entries, from March to May 2013, provide a nearly-daily run-down of a hole for a parking lot(?) getting dug next to Jajah’s Mountain View headquarters. Yes, a hole in the ground.
The entries have mundane headlines like “Very substantial activity” and “Looks like one more level down” with equally dull pictures to match. (The one I’ve used to illustrate this post was called “More reinforcing”, which seems particularly ironic when you consider that the exact opposite appeared to be happening to Jajah itself.)
The message: nothing of any interest whatsoever going on at Jajah, and no one seems to notice or care that that’s the case.
The entries prior to that record a couple of employee trips to South America. Before that, the last product announcement was from 2011, when Jajah released a mobile app with Facebook calling features .
It’s a whimper of an ending for Jajah. Founded originally in 2005 by Roman Scharf and Daniel Mattes (who then went on to found payments company Jumio ), it was  backed with $33 million  from the likes of Sequoia, Intel and Deutsche Telekom’s T-Venture.
Jajah was once viewed as a real competitive threat against the likes of Skype and Vonage. Part of that was because Jajah actually offered VoIP alternatives that easily integrated with what people already used to make calls. While Skype required users to download an app — and then it worked within that app, with Jajah, users only had to go online to enter their number, and that of the number they were calling. That then provided a VoIP bridge between two basic landline (or mobile) numbers, reducing the price of the call in the process.
Hype and interest in Jajah  ratcheted up further in 2009 , after Google acquired its competitor Gizmo5 . Rumours swirled that Telefonica, Microsoft and Cisco were all eyeing up the company for a price between $200 million and $400 million, with reports of some 25 million subscribers and growing. (Interestingly, Microsoft did get its VoIP service in the end with Skype.)
Ultimately, the sale to Telefonica was at the low end of that range, and for what turned out to be 15 million users. And the spin on the deal was not so positive. At the time, we wrote:
“The sale was not a happy affair for everyone involved, however. The deal was largely driven by Jajah’s investors, particularly Sequoia . We hear CTO  Amichay Oren  has left the company because he and his engineering team in Israel didn’t get treated the same as their counterparts in the U.S. In these types of deals, not everyone ends up winning. Jajah turned out not to be the next $1 billion company in Sequoia’s portfolio.”
Still, it seemed like a strategic fit for Jajah to go to Telefonica. And on Telefonica’s side, it looked like a bold move by a staid, incumbent carrier to propel itself into the future of telephony. Alas, perhaps Telefonica wasn’t really ready to take such a disruptive leap at the time, or perhaps the tech wasn’t really there for that leap, or perhaps something else.
The bigger picture is that today, Skype is enormous, and there are dozens of other alternatives out there that do things like connect your voice calling up seamlessly with people who you message. And besides all that, we all now get hundreds of minutes thrown in with our mobile phone plans.
As is customary when a telephony service shuts down, its users have the right to put in an appeal to the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC needs to authorize the discontinuation of the service, “unless it is shown that customers would be unable to receive service or a reasonable substitute from another carrier or that the public convenience and necessity is otherwise adversely affected.”
Given that there are a number of other VoIP as well as non-VoIP services available today, offering this option to customers seems like more of a formality than an actual possibility to keep the service going.
