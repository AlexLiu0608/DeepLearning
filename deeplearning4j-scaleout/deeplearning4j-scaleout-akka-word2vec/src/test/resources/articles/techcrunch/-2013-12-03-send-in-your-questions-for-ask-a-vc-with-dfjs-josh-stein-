After Raising $200M More, Airbnb Built A Replica Of The Dr. Strangelove War Room In Its Office
Ask a VC is back this week after a brief hiatus–and our guest this week is DFJ managing director Josh Stein . As you may remember, you can submit questions for our guests either in the comments or here and we’ll ask them during the show.
Stein has backed and serves on the boards of Box, Chartbeat, LendKey, Selligy, SugarCRM, and Swell. He is also actively involved with DFJ’s investments in AngelList, Glam Media, Opscode, Path, Redfin, Tremor Video, and Twilio. His previous investments include GoodGuide (acquired by UL), iList (acquired by IGN/News Corp), Polaris Wireless (strategic recapitalization), Yammer (acquired by Microsoft), and Yardbarker (acquired by Fox Sports Interactive).
Prior to joining DFJ, Stein was a Vice President at Telephia, and was a co-founder, Director and the Chief Strategy Officer for ViaFone. He also held positions in product management at Microsoft and NetObjects, and was a management consultant in the San Francisco office of The Boston Consulting Group.
Stein has made some early investments in clear winners in enterprise and beyond, including leading Box’s first round of institutional investment back in 2006. We’re curious to hear what patterns he’s observed in finding and backing successful entrepreneurs and companies.
