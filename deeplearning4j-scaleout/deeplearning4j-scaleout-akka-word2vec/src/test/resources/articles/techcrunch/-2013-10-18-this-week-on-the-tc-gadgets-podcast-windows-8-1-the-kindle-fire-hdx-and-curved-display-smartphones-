That’s right. It’s Gadgets Podcast time once again, and all I can say is TGIF.
Here are some of our topics this week:
Who’s already upgraded to Windows 8.1? John had no trouble with it but Matt seems to be lost .
Meanwhile, we’ve been testing out the new Amazon Kindle Fire HDX , and we all pretty much agree that it’s a fine media-centric tablet and a perfect gift for a mother-in-law.
And finally, we discuss the newest trend in smartphones: a curved display. (Here’s Nokia’s concept for a bending display smartphone , which is many years away from commercialization, and also completely different from the curved displays we’re seeing out of Samsung and LG ).
Oh, and we’ll be launching our holiday gift guide in the coming weeks, so keep an eye out for that.
We chat about all this and more in this week’s episode of the TC Gadgets Podcast , featuring John Biggs , Matt Burns  and Jordan Crook .
Enjoy!
We invite you to enjoy our weekly podcasts every Friday at 3 p.m. Eastern and noon Pacific. And feel free to check out the TechCrunch Gadgets Flipboard magazine right here .
