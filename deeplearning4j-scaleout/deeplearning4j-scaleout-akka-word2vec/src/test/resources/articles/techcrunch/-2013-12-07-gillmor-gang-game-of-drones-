Gillmor Gang: Game of Drones
The Gillmor Gang — John Borthwick, Robert Scoble, Dan Farber, Doc Searls, and Steve Gillmor — imagine a world 30 years in the future and discover it looks pretty much the same. A world where drones drop things off and pick them up, too. Why buy when you can rinse, rent, and repeat. The signs are everywhere, as the cloud makes anything possible at startup scale. The question is, can anyone but Google and Apple win?
Form versus function is the framing of the media, but perhaps the real winners will capture the broad audience with fitness data topped with media services. Twitter is serving up viral swarms around binge programming, and soon we’ll be telling our wrist bands to sort the mail and start the dishwasher. It’s more and more difficult to tell the robots from their makers. Pass the oil, please.
