IBM is saying that this was a record breaking Black Friday by online sales but it’s unclear what that number is–so we’ll see what comScore reports with sales over the next few days. U.S. e-commerce spending last year on Black Friday was $1.042 billion , an increase of 26 percent from 2012. Black Friday online sales actually surpassed $1 billion for the first time last year. But comScore is forecasting double-digit growth in both desktop e-commerce and m-commerce spending for the holiday season.
