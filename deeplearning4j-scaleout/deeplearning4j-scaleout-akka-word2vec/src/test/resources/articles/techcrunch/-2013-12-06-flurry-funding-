NSA Claims Collecting Cellphone Location Data Is Legal Under Executive Order — From 1981
Mobile analytics company Flurry has raised $12.5 million in new funding, as first revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and confirmed by a Flurry spokesperson.
The company started out as an app developer before shifting its focus to analytics and then using its data for advertising. It raised a $25 million round about a year ago, and at the time, CEO Simon Khalaf hinted at a possible IPO and said the company had become cash-flow positive.
Flurry told me today that 400,000 apps are using its analytics product, with 20,000 additions each month, and that it’s tracking activity from 1.2 billion smartphones and tablets. It also said that it’s working with 125,000 developers.
The company has now raised a total of $62.5 million, the spokesperson said, but she declined to identify the investors in the new round.
