Yahoo Acquires PeerCDN As It Builds Out Its Content Strategy
Amazon made waves with its Amazon Air drone delivery concept , and a video of a recent test flight really brought that concept to life. Now robotics startup and iPhone-enabled toy maker Sphero has a concept of its own to reveal, complete with a shot-for-shot remake of the original video by the online e-commerce giant – they call it Amazon Ground.
Sphero makes iPhone-controlled rolling spherical robots that light up and can play a number of app-enabled games using one or more units, and the video above, while created for laffs, does give you an idea of what they’re capable of. The company released version 2.0 of the Sphero earlier this year, and Amazon’s a key retail partner .
Using Sphero in this way is of course rife with logistical problems, not least of which would be the overwhelming urge to kick these diminutive delivery people clear across the street should you encounter them in the wild. Don’t get me wrong, I find Sphero very endearing, but a ball must needs kicking. This is a well-crafted parody tribute, but those spherical robots do look right at home in that warehouse and could conceivably be of some limited use in that specific setting, so who knows what the future will bring.
