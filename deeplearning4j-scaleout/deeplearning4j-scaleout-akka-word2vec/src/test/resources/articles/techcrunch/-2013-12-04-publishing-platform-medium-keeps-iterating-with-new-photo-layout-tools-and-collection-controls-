NSA Reportedly Tracking Cell Phone Location Data
Medium, the blog publishing platform from Twitter co-founder Evan Williams, has today released new features and a few design changes.
Medium has sprouted from a seedling to a full-fledged media tool in the last year , recently opening sign-ups to the public.
Today, however, the tool gets a bit of a revamp, with more placement and layout options for photos, giving the writer extra control over the layout of the story. Williams is calling it Medium 1.0.
Here’s what he said about it in the official blog post :
We’re calling this release Medium 1.0 because we feel it represents a major milestone for the product. It has all the core components to be the simple-but-powerful idea distribution system we set out to build. But, by definition, 1.0 means this is the beginning. We’re just getting started.
Medium is also adding the ability to add a cover photo (including a “wash” on that cover photo) as well as the ability to place full bleed photos throughout the story. Captions can also be added.
Though the refresh brings about a few additional choices, like updated fonts, the company assures us that the process “remains incredibly streamlined and simple.”
Medium has also made some big changes to collections, including more robust stats and data around the curation feature. Williams admits in the blog post that collections were a bit confusing before, but says that’s about to change.
From now on, collections are closed by default, keeping the creator as the sole editor of the collection unless otherwise specified. The creator, called an Editor, can then decide what other pieces to include in their collection by searching or taking submissions. Making and accepting submissions to one another’s collections is intended to create a more engaging blogging audience, with true curators floating to the top.

Medium continues to iterate and grow at a quick pace, but is remaining tight-lipped when it comes to any real user numbers or traction figures. But then again, this is “just the beginning” for the next-gen blogging platform.
