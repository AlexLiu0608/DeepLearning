On Strength Of Chicago’s Growth, Instacart Launches Grocery-Delivery Service In Boston
As we previously reported , Amazon has launched its grocery-delivery service in San Francisco today.
The service was previously available in Seattle and Los Angeles, but has now extended to the San Francisco Bay Area.
AmazonFresh costs $299/year and promises fresh produce, meats, dairy and more delivered on the same or next day. Prime membership is automatically included.
Grocery delivery seems to be a hobby for Amazon, which is looking to be your one-stop shop for online shopping. Today, Amazon is the digital incarnation of what Target was for brick-and-mortar.
By offering groceries, Amazon can loop customers into a subscription for something they need regularly. The hope is that each visit results in a wandering eye and extra purchases from Amazon’s never-ending catalog of products.
Right now, AmazonFresh competes with Instacart, which today launched in Boston, and Walmart in the grocery deliver vertical.
If you’re in the San Francisco Bay Area and want to try out AmazonFresh, head over here and sign up .
