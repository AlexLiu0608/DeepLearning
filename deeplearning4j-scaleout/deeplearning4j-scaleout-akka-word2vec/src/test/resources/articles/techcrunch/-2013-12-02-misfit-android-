Misfit Wearables, the Khosla and Founders Fund-backed startup that builds elegant activity tracking hardware , is patching up a weak spot with the launch of its new Android app today.
It was something that prospective customers balked at when the company launched back in the summer.
Misfit makes the Shine, a quarter-sized activity tracker that’s popular among women and costs about $99.95. The team behind the product built the first medical device that was approved for use with the iPhone — a glucose meter. Those relationships helped them secure key distribution partnerships with all Apple stores worldwide, Best Buy and some Target locations.
It has a paired app that syncs through Bluetooth with a cool animation and pulls in all of your activity data in day-by-day graphs.
They’re bringing the Android version to market today, at least a month earlier than they had promised. They had pledged to have a live Android version “early next year.” Early reviews show that it’s crashing on some devices, though Misfit says it has fixes coming in the next version.
Earlier this week, they also released an update to the app that brings some social features — users can see when their friends are passing them in points and get regular alerts. Jawbone has a similar feature where you can compare yourself against friends.
