“Post-Print” Startup Stateless Media Creates Short, Smart Documentaries For The Web
There really isn’t much we don’t know about Google and LG’s new Nexus 5 at this point — a leaked service manual blew the door open on plenty of technical details, and Google even “accidentally” outed the device in the Google Play Store, giving us a $349 price tag for the base 16GB model.
Now, thanks to the one and only @evleaks , we’ve gotten yet another glimpse of the forthcoming phone in some decidedly different livery. Rather than the bog-standard matte black finish we’ve seen on and off for the past few months, this newly leaked image shows off a white version of the device ahead of its official launch… whenever that may be.
In case you haven’t been keeping up with the Nexus 5′s long journey from rumor to actual product , the Android 4.4 KitKat device is said to sport a 4.95-inch display running at 1080p and a quad-core Snapdragon 800 chipset clocked at 2.3GHz. Oh, and let’s not forget 2GB of RAM, an active LTE radio, and a mildly improved 2300mAh battery — all told we’re looking at a pretty solid update.
Arguably more important than that new chromatic choice is the latest in a long line of purported release dates for the Nexus 5 — this time it looks like November 1 is the day to circle on your calendars. For a while there it looked like we would get our first official glimpse at the Nexus 5 on October 15, a day that came and went with nary a peep from Google. Then there came word of a small Google Play event slated for the evening of the 24th in New York City, which ultimately turned out to be little more than a meet-and-greet for certain members of the press.
Couple that with a separate report from the folks at MobileSyrup forecasting a launch on October 31 and it’s starting to seem very likely that the Nexus 5 will make its grand debut at the end of the month. Of course, that’s only a few days away and there’s still no smoking gun — Google hasn’t started distributing invitations — so we’ll see just how much longer this not-so-secret secret winds up staying under wraps. Curiously enough, the Nexus 5 may not be alone when it hits the Google Play Store for real. An LTE-enabled version of the Nexus 4 put in an appearance in the Bluetooth Special Interest Group’s device certification listings.
