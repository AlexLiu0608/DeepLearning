Twitter Is About To Officially Launch Retargeted Ads [Update: Confirmed]
Wywy , a German company promising to help monetize TV activity on mobile devices, is announcing that it has raised $7 million in Series B funding.
According to the wywy website , the company’s history goes back to 2001, with video and audio detection technology, but it only launched its second screen products last year. Those products include multi-screen ad synchronization, so that mobile and tablet users see online advertising that corresponds to the commercial they’re seeing on TV; real-time TV campaign tracking; and content sync technology for second screen apps.
The company also offers an app of its own, but it sounds like that’s just meant to showcase wywy’s technology for potential customers.
The new funding follows a $3.1 million Series A last year and comes from existing investors Cipio Partners. Wywy says it currently supports 200 channels in five countries, and one of the big goals is to expand in Europe and the United States.
“Today, using a Second Screen device in parallel to watching TV has become the norm,” said Cipio managing partner Werner Dreesbach in the funding release. “It is clear that TV advertisers require new approaches to ensure the effectiveness of their campaigns. wywy’s huge success with media agencies and TV advertisers in Germany made the decision to internationalize easy.”
