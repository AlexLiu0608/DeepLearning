After announcing a new version of its credit card reader this morning, Square is debuting a new website today.
As the company explains, this new site reflects where web design is headed, and where Square customers are headed as well, which is ubiquity across devices and countries. Square’s new site has more attention to design, especially with attention to being device agnostic, including on desktop, tablet, or phone. Square says it has developed SVG animations and motion graphics, and is using a request animation frame to ensure that performance on the site is up to the maximum refresh rate of 60fps for smooth scrolling.
The website noticeably reflects the company’s new marketplace efforts, in-store technologies and hardware efforts. It seems to be an accurate reflection of what Square is today (as opposed to the mobile payments-focus of the company a few years back).
