CrunchBase Updates Terms of Service and Adopts Creative Commons 4.0
Earlier today we updated our  Terms of Service  for the first time since the  CrunchBase API  was launched in July 2008.  Back then, CrunchBase listed only 5k companies and the startup community was just beginning to figure out what insights could be drawn from the CrunchBase dataset.  Today, CrunchBase includes profiles on over 200k companies plus the founders, investors, and fundings that have brought those companies to life.  With thousands of updates pouring in every day from the community, the  CrunchBase Venture Program   and our partners, it’s no surprise that 5k registered developers are working with the API and tens of thousands of people have downloaded our monthly data exports .
Our revised Terms of Service provide additional clarity on how the CrunchBase dataset can be leveraged for research and application development.  Following our commitment to make the terms as clear as possible, CrunchBase worked closely with the Electronic Frontier Foundation to incorporate Creative Commons 4.0 and to follow established best practices.  ”CrunchBase’s new terms of service are clearer and more in line with the best practices of the open content community,” said Mitch Stoltz, a Staff Attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “The new terms should allow developers to re-use and build on the CrunchBase dataset with greater confidence”.  The new terms ensure that the CrunchBase dataset continues to be a valuable resource that thousands of developers and researchers can rely upon.
The CrunchBase dataset is now offered under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 license [ CC-BY-NC ].  As with our previous terms, non-commercial use of the CrunchBase dataset simply requires attribution.  We also encourage commercial use of the CrunchBase dataset, in whole or in part.  Commercial uses do require a separate license to safeguard the community’s investment in the CrunchBase, as well as protect the dataset’s integrity.  Members of the CrunchBase Venture Program do not require a new license.
