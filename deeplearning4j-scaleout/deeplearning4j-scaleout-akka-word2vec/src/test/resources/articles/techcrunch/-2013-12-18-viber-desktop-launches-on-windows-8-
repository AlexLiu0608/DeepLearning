Viber first launched on the desktop back in May, with support for PC and Mac.
Today, the company is extending the offer to Windows 8-powered users, with features tailored especially to the operating system.
In the Windows 8 version of Viber desktop, users can pin conversations to their Start screen, snap Viber to the side of the screen with Snap View, and search for Viber contacts using the universal search charm.
As is the case with other versions of Viber, Windows 8 users will also be able to switch between desktop and mobile with a single push of a button.
Here’s what CEO and founder Talmon Marco had to say about the release:
his is the natural next step for Viber following our support for Windows Phone 8, bringing a fully compatible and custom designed version of Viber to Microsoft’s touch-friendly OS. Windows 8 is an exciting platform to develop for, and brings a whole new set of UI elements and unique functionality to Viber for the first time. We are excited to support Viber users on Windows 8 and this is part of our commitment to wide, cross platform availability.
Viber recently launched a competitive calling feature that lets Viber users call non-viber users on either mobile or landline, the same way that Skype works. The main difference between the two is price, with Viber costing far less than Skype in most situations.
