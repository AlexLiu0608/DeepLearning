This Christmas, we saw one surefire way to get Americans to put down their phones: give them a stack of presents. While there was certainly a lot to covet this year — from gold iPhones to personal drones — we’re of a singular mindset at Mixpanel: data is one gift that truly keeps on giving.
We’re pleased to give you one last, belated present: the second annual Mixpanel Christmas Metrics report. We’ve taken a deeper dive into metrics from December 25, 2013, to paint a portrait of consumer behavior on a day that many spend with family, friends, and handheld devices.
Every month, Mixpanel analyzes more than 17 billion actions. This report is based on actions analyzed by Mixpanel on December 25, 2013, December 25, 2012, and on November 28, 2013 (Thanksgiving). Actions in Mixpanel are defined by our customers and can be anything from making a purchase to finishing a level in a game. Over 1,700 businesses use Mixpanel to better understand their customers’ activity and engagement. All traffic in this report was generated by people in the United States.
Christmas Traditions: Family, Friends, and an Internet Connection
For a day traditionally spent with family and friends, we saw Americans also spent some quality time on their devices. On December 25, 2013, Mixpanel analyzed 1.2 billion actions, a 66% increase over last Christmas (December 25, 2012). And on Christmas Day, a whopping 90% of activity was generated in mobile apps.
There was a significant dip in traffic around 10:30 in the morning, with a sharp spike at noon and another peak at 2:00 in the afternoon, which suggests to us that Americans put down the handhelds to open their presents mid-morning, then jumped back on their devices in the early afternoon once the gift-giving frenzy had died down. The dip is notable when compared to the same chart from December 14, just two Saturdays prior.
