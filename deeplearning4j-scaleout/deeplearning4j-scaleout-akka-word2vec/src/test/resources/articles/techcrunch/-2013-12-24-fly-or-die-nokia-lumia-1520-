Nokia Lumia 1520 | Fly or Die
Nokia is now basically the defacto Windows Phone handset manufacturer, and the Lumia 1520 is its latest effort. The big, big full HD 6-inch display sets it apart from any previous Windows Phone device, and puts it into a rare class of device even among Android phones, whose screens can also get pretty darn huge.
The screen is great, but the phone is a crime against nature. Or at least, that’s my side of the story. Chris predictably sees it differently, because he’s blind. Of course, there are some arguments in favor of the gargantuan device, but they melt away when you try to wrangle one in a human-sized hand.
You can probably predict how the chips fall given that description, but watch for the Christmas sweaters, and stay for the verdict.
