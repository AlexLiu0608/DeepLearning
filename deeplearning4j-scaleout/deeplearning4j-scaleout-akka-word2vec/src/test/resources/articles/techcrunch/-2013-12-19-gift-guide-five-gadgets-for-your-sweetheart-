Atheer Labs Turns To Crowdfunding To Bring Its 3D Augmented Reality Glasses To Life
The most important gift you give this holiday season will be the gift you give your sweetheart. After all, this is the person you get sex from.
That said, these are some cute last-minute ideas that will keep you out of the dog house come New Year’s Eve.
HBloom Subscriptions ($75/delivery)
HBloom is a creative flower delivery service that offers a wide range of products — these are the same folks that came up with the SuperHero package, which delivers flowers to a guy’s work so that he can be the one to give them to his sweetheart. Now, the company offers floral delivery subscriptions, with new arrangements arriving weekly, bi-weekly or monthly. All you do is meet up with a design consultant who checks out the space and learns about your tastes and the deliveries begin. Starts at $75 per delivery .
HowAboutWe Couples ($10/month)
HowAboutWe keeps the romance alive by offering up interesting date ideas based on your location. Awesomely enough, the service offers a $10/month membership for couples , which hooks you up with up to 75% off the dates, one free date, and access to sold out shows and booked clubs. There are some cute ideas on there, but the best idea of all is you showing your partner how important it is to go on special, interesting dates. You know, like you did when you first fell in love.
Couple (Free)
Ok, you caught me. This isn’t necessarily a gift because technically it’s free. However, signing up for Couple and inviting your partner to join you in your own private social network can be pretty romantic. Couple lets you chat, share pictures, drawings, and location, and it even lets you draw simultaneously in a live sketch. With the new foursquare integration, users can suggest date spots and the thumbkiss feature is cheesy but fun. The app automatically stores important dates for your partner and the relationship, like birthdays and anniversaries, and you can share lists to stay on top of things as a couple. Hey, some of the best things in life are free.
HelloTouch ($55)
Or you could spend $55 on a really, really fun night in the bedroom. The Jimmyjane HelloTouch vibrator may seem a bit awkward at first — after all, it is reminiscent of those Spider Man-style shooter toys you wear on your wrist. But once those finger pads get to buzzing it won’t seem so awkward anymore. The HelloTouch can be worn a few different ways so that everyone can enjoy, and it even comes in a Holiday package , including a stocking, handcuffs and a blindfold.
