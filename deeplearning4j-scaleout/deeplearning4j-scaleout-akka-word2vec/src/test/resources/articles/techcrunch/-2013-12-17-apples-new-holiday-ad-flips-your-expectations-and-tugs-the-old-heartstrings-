Crowdfunded Iron Man Suit Project Seeking 5K Pre-Orders For Production Run
Oh, brooding, teenage boy apparently dejected at holiday family gathering, I was you once. But unlike the character in Apple’s note-perfect holiday commercial embedded above, I was doing terrible things like texting with my friends about how lame everything was and playing Snake, not capturing sentimental moments shared with family to surprise them with later.
Apple may get flack from the Android camp for not opening up its platform enough and other grave sins related to things that mostly concern us super nerds, but Apple has a knack for consistently nailing the human aspect of technology, which is what’s on display with this commercial. I’m still willing to bet that in real life, that volta where everything’s revealed to be sweetness and good feeling is a rarified occurrence, but you still got me right in the feels, Apple.
