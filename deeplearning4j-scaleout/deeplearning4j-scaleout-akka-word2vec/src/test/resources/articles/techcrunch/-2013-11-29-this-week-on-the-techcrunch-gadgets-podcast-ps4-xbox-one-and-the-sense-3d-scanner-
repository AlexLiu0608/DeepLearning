Happy Thanksgiving, dear readers. What are you thankful for?
My list is short, but sweet: I’m thankful for you guys, gaming consoles, and 3d scanners.
This week, on a very grateful episode of the TechCrunch Gadgets podcast, we look into the differences between the PS4 and the Xbox One , the latest generations of console gaming. Meanwhile, John’s excited about the new Sense scanner from 3D Systems, even though he can’t stop calling it “Scene”.
For our phone fans out there, we’re also chatting about the Moto G smartphone.
We discuss all this and more on this week’s episode of the TC Gadgets Podcast , featuring John Biggs , Matt Burns , and Darrell Etherington , and Chris Velazco .
Enjoy!
We invite you to enjoy our weekly podcasts every Friday at 3 p.m. Eastern and noon Pacific. And feel free to check out the TechCrunch Gadgets Flipboard magazine right here .
