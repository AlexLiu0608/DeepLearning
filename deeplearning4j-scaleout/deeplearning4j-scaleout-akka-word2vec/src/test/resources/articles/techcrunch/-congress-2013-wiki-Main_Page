The Event
The 30th Chaos Communication Congress (30C3) is an annual four-day conference on technology, society and utopia. The Congress offers lectures and workshops and various events on a multitude of topics including (but not limited to) information technology and generally a critical-creative attitude towards technology and the discussion about the effects of technological advances on society.
For 30 years, the congress has been organized by the community and appreciates all kinds of participation. You are encouraged to contribute by volunteering , setting up and hosting hands-on and self-organized events with the other components of your assembly or presenting your own projects to fellow hackers.
