Facebook Announces Secondary Offering Of 70M Shares, Raising Around $4B, As It Joins S&P500 Index
New York-based startup Floored just closed a $5.26 million Series A funding round led by RRE Ventures to fuel its business. This round seems to be all about growth and going to the next level.
Greycroft Partners also invested in today’s round, as well as existing investors Lerer Ventures, Two Sigma Ventures and Felicis Ventures. Previously, the company had raised $1 million in seed funding.
As a reminder, Floored is a Disrupt NY 2013 finalist . It scans office spaces, apartments and houses using 3D camera technology and proprietary software to build customizable 3D models for real estate purposes.
But the real game-changer lies in the use of 3D. For example, after an office space is scanned, you can easily move around and add furniture in real-time to realize whether the space would be a good fit for your company. Or you could even work with Floored to tear down a wall, add a counter and many other things.
To scan interior spaces, Floored used to use Kinect-like sensors. But the company has recently switched to laser scanners instead, which have a longer range and are more expensive. Scanning a space is a matter of hours. After that, Floored cleans up the data in-house and renders the result in real time for the web and its iPad app — the entire process takes a couple of days.
Here’s the result in WebGL with Floored’s new graphics engine (the web viewer was just updated):
For a real estate company, using these scans is as easy as embedding a YouTube video on your website. Click here to see the upcoming version of the web viewer with new features (full screen view, map…).
The new funding will allow the company to grow its engineering team and probably be able to make more 3D scans — existing customers include Hines, Taconic Investment Partners, Related Companies, CBRE and Cushman Wakefield.
Having the best proprietary technology and locking the market are the two key elements to Floored’s success. The new influx of money should help the company get there.
