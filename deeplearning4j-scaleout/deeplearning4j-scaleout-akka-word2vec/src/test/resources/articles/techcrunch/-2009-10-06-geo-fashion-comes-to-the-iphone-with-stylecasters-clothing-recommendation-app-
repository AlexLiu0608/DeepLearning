Interactive fashion community StyleCaster has launched an iPhone app that answers the age-old questions that many women (and men) ask themselves when they wake up in the morning: “What’s the weather outside?” and “What should I wear?”  StyleCaster’s free iPhone app pulls in a weather feed and will give you the recommendations of styled “looks” based on your current location and weather conditions.
The app also has much of the functionality of StyleCaster’s site, which aims to be a one-stop-shop for fashionistas. The app lets users access style tips optimized for each individual, news, videos and content on the latest fashion and beauty trends, and a large online retail catalog of brand-name clothing. With each look that is recommended by StyleCaster’s app,  you can see the products used in the featured outfits, where to purchase them, as well as learn about the stylist, hair stylist, make up artist and model.
Interestingly, StyleCaster is monetizing the app by advertising. Rugby, a brand of designer Ralph Lauren, is the inaugural sponsor of the app and StyleCaster will continue to feature various sponsors. In July, StyleCaster raised $4 million in a Series A round of financing from investor Dan Gilbert, the chairman and founder of Quicken Loans, to pursue technologies in the mobile space. I’m definitely a fan of this app and especially love the feature of giving me personalized recommendations based on my location. If it could only sync up with my closet, I’d be in heaven.
