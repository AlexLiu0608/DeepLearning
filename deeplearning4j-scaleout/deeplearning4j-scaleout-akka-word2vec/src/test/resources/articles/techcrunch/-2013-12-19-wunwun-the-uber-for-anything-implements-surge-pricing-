Apple Patents Displays With Better Color And A Maps App With Web-Based Data Layers
WunWun , the on-demand delivery service for anything, is changing things up a bit to streamline operations.
The company is introducing some version of surge pricing, wherein users can pay an extra $10 to “get it now”, rather than wait for free delivery. Both the free delivery ETAs and the “get it now” prices are subject to change based on demand, with a cap at six hours for waiting and $30 for immediate service.
A lot has been said recently about surge pricing , especially as it relates to Uber.
Time will tell if WunWun users will stand for paying higher rates for something they used to get for free, which was super fast and free delivery of anything.
On-demand services seem to be able to get away with surge pricing, as users tend to be more liberal spenders.
The update also allows for an “Indoor delivery” option that costs $5, which means that the WunWun helper will get off their bike, lock it, buzz into the apartment building, and come upstairs to your front door.
The company says that it saves between ten and 15 minutes each time a customer receives their order at the front door.
In the past, WunWun used to offer free on-demand delivery from stores, and charge a $20 fee for custom orders like restaurant delivery, picking up someone from the airport, or having a key copied.
Now, custom orders automatically include “Get it now” and indoor delivery.
WunWun claims to be growing 50 percent month-over-month, but won’t clarify the exact number of users on the service.
The app is only available in New York.
