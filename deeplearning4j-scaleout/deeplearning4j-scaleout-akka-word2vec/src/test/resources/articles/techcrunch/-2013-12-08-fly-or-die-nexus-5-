Nexus 5 Review | Fly or Die
The Nexus 5 is the latest generation of Google’s Android software, KitKat, come to life.
The hardware itself isn’t super glamorous, with a simple 5-inch display and a matte black backside, but the software more than makes up for what can be a bland appearance.
The 1080p display is quite nice, at 445 ppi, and the Snapdragon 800 processor under the hood keeps things snappy and smooth. But perhaps most important is the Nexus 5 camera, which has been upgraded in the software department to take truly beautiful photos. Plus, the Nexus 5 charges wirelessly.
Chris Velazco, our resident mobile geek, and John Biggs weigh in on the Nexus 5 in this episode of Fly or Die. But ultimately, the decision is yours. Is the Nexus 5 worth your time? Let us know in the comments.
