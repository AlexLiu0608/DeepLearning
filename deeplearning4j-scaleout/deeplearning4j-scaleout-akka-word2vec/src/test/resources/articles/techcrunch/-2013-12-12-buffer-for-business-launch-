Enterprise Social Network Convo Adds At-Rest Encryption To Its Servers To Better Protect Client Data
SF-based Buffer , the social media scheduling tool has officially launched its Buffer for Business product after a small private beta that ran during the past few months. Buffer lets users schedule updates and deliver messages via Facebook, Twitter and other social channels, which has become a key ingredient for any brands with an online presence. It arguably always appealed to business users, but the new Business product offers detailed analytics, collaboration with entire teams and easy export of your data for use in other applications.
Buffer for Business has already had a material impact on Buffer’s bottom line, even in its limited beta release form. Co-founder Leo Widrich says that over the course of the beta, they’ve signed up 400 paying users already, which amounted to $23,000 in revenue in a single month, or roughly 10 percent of their overall revenue. Business clients offer a significant revenue opportunity for Buffer, since it can sell better to institutions and organizations with deeper pockets than it could with its original product.
According to Widrich, Buffer took a consumer turn last year as part of a concentrated effort to attract individual users, and that resulted in partnerships with various companies including Feedly and Echofon. To a certain extent this worked (individual user growth was on a roll partway through last year ), but the company also determined that a specific focus on business would also be beneficial to its bottom line.
