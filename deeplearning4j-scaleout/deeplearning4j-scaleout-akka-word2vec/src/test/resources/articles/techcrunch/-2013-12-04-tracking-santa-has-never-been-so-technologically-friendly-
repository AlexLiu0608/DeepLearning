Infamous Hacker Creates SkyJack To Hunt, Hack, And Control Other Drones
Tradition is a beautiful thing. As the world speeds up, goes digital, and eventually airborne, certain traditions keep us grounded throughout the years. One such tradition is tracking Santa across the globe with the NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command) Santa Tracker.
This year, the Santa Tracker is much improved ( thanks mostly to Microsoft ) but without losing the traditional Christmas cheer that we’ve grown accustomed to.
For one, Redmond has created a 3D claymation universe for Chris Cringle, including Santa’s village on the North Pole.
The claymation fits perfectly with the holiday spirit, as many of the best Christmas classic movies were made in claymation, such as Rudolph, The Red Nosed Reindeer and Frosty The Snowman.
Adding to the claymation wonder, Microsoft has also made the Santa Tracker a touch-friendly experience, migrating the JavaScript-powered website to mobile and tablets as well as the web.
Starting now, users can check out Santa’s 3D claymation village and play games that will be released daily, as well as check out music and other content.
Then, on December 24, users will be able to follow Santa around the globe as he makes his Christmas deliveries.
And to boot, NORAD has added some fighter jets into the Santa Tracker animated video. You know, to keep things realistic.
It’s a pretty cute way to upgrade a 50+ year tradition, and considering that kids these days much prefer iPads to magazines, Microsoft has surely helped a generation of parents share their childhood traditions with their own, next-gen children.
Merry Christmas, everyone.
