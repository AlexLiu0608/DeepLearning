NSA And Other Intelligence Agencies Got All Up In Your World Of Warcraft, Xbox Live
Square did indeed reveal something new today as promised , and it’s a credit card reader design update, which is what we suggested was most likely yesterday when they teased the news. The new reader is thinner, and has a design that’s supposed to improve success rates at reading cards. Finally, the 3.5mm audio jack plug has been redesigned to play nicely with many more devices.
The new Square Reader is heading to store shelves as of next year, but it’s available now for free via the official Square website. In case you’re wondering just how thin it is, it’s about the depth of the iPhone 5 or 5s, so that actually is size savings of about half versus the thickness of the original version. It’s also got sharper edges, and honestly does look like a big improvement, even if the news isn’t earth-shattering.
