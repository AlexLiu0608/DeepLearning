Fastest growing company in the Medicare industry partners to reach       18,000 pharmacies
NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–December 11, 2013–
iMedicare ,       the high growth Medicare decision-making platform, announced today that       it now has 1,000 pharmacies as paying customers nationwide and has       performed over 100,000 Medicare plan comparisons for seniors enrolling       in affordable health insurance plans this year.
By partnering with over 40 pharmacy organizations, including the       National Community Pharmacy Association (NCPA) and the Federation of       Pharmacy Networks (FPN), iMedicare now directly reaches over 18,000       pharmacies (26% of the market).
Recently, iMedicare introduced the capability to see which plans have a       closed preferred pharmacy network or tend to prefer mail order to retail       pharmacies. “We believe patients stay healthier and take their       medications when they have a trusted resource in their pharmacist.       iMedicare helps strengthen that relationship and we have 1,000       pharmacies telling everyone about it,” said iMedicare CEO Flaviu       Simihaian.
And not only are pharmacies telling patients about it, but pharmacies       themselves are also reaping tremendous benefits. “The iMedicare software       has been a great investment for us. It easily pays for itself by simply       getting one person on to insurance without having the facility pick up       the charges or the resident as a private pay,” said Keith Wallace, VP at       Tara Pharmacy, a long-term care pharmacy in Missouri.
“Today, with iMedicare I feel confident in my approach to help my       patients. It’s simple and patients enjoy the fact that I have a tool to       help them with their decisions. I see this building a relationship with       my patients,” said Scott Stanley, owner of Stanley Pharmacy.
Michelle Williams, owner of The Pillbox Pharmacy, said, “We started       using the iMedicare program at one of our other locations and it is       absolutely amazing! Our customers think that we are the best for helping       them make an informed decision about their health care plan for the       coming year.”
iMedicare will expand to more pharmacies in 2014, helping more patients       in unprecedented ways, including performing an expected 1 million+       Medicare plan comparisons. At this rate of growth, iMedicare projects       surpassing $9 million in annual revenue in 2014.
