Intuit has acquired Full Slate , which makes appointment scheduling software for small businesses.
Full Slate will join the Intuit’s Demandforce team and will integrate its scheduler, customer relationship management, and e-commerce capabilities.
Small businesses can quickly embed an online appointment scheduler with Full Slate’s website widget, complete with real-time openings, custom booking forms, and instant alerts
Demandforce is an Intuit property that offers automated marketing and communications tools for small businesses. It helps them engage with their customers, collect verified feedback from clients and promote it on the Web, and build their online reputations.
Clients are businesses like salons, auto shops, chiropractors, dentists, and veterinarian, where appointments make up a core part of their business.
The acquisition of Full Slate will let Demandforce clients easily set up online schedulers.
Full Slate said that having an appointment scheduler on a website is like having a “virtual receptionist 24/7.” This one feature can reduce the amount of missed calls, lost leads, and no shows, convert potential clients and keep the loyalty of existing ones.
The company was founded in 2008 to help small businesses better sell their services on the Web.  Full Slate claims that over 70% of consumers say they want to make appointments online, and this kind of convenience can be the deciding factor when choosing a service provider.
The amount of the deal was not disclosed.
Intuit is an active acquirer and this is its sixth acquisition this year.
