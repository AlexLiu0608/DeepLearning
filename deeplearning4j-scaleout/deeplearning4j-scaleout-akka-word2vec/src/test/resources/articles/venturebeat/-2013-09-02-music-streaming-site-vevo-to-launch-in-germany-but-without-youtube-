Music streaming site Vevo , which is run by some of the largest music companies such as Sony Music and Universal Music, is to roll out in Germany without YouTube as a partner.
Founded in 2009, Vevo’s past forays outside of North America have always been accompanied with a YouTube partnership. On entering Europe’s largest music market, Vevo international SVP Nic Jones said to the Financial Times , “This is a very different launch from the ones we’ve done before.”
Though it’s a bold move for Vevo, it’s not unexpected considering the ongoing battle between YouTube and German copyright society GEMA, which began in 2009. Earlier this year, the ugly dispute took a new twist when GEMA filed an application for damages with the German Patent and Trademark Office accusing YouTube of using 1,000 unlicensed works in its repertoire.
Although the company still has the launch date under wraps,  Berliner Morgenpost reports that Vevo Germany will open its headquarters in Berlin.
