Lenovo Yoga tablet 8-inch Source: Devindra Hardawar/VentureBeat
Under the hood, the Yoga is powered by Android 4.2 and a quad-core processor. A Lenovo representative tells me the two models are exactly the same hardware-wise, aside from the different screen sizes. The 8-inch version weighs 0.88 pounds, while the 10-inch is 1.34 pounds.
In my brief hands-on time with the tablets, I found myself drawn to the smaller model. It felt light yet sturdy thanks to a thin design and metal case, and its bulbous end actually made it easier to hold with one hand. Lenovo didn’t skimp on the Yoga’s kickstand either: It’s crafted out of metal, and it felt impressively sturdy as I unfolded it. When the kickstand is resting inside the tablet, it fits flat and neat. The 10-inch model felt similarly sturdy, but more awkward when held one-handed (typical for big tablets.)
For a $249 tablet, the 8-inch Yoga also feels surprisingly luxurious. It’s only $10 more than the new Nexus 7, which feels less professional (no metal there). And its 18 hours of reported battery life are around double what most other tablets offer.
The Yoga’s rounded edge reminds me a bit of what Sony attempted with its Xperia S and Z tablets, which mimicked a folded magazine to make it easier to hold. Lenovo’s implementation feels more ergonomic though, and it’s priced much lower.
Kutcher’s role in the announcement felt somewhat bizarre, especially since Lenovo claimed that he helped with its design (it’s hard to tell if that was just a bad corporate joke or if the company is being serious). In a livestream event tonight, Kutcher recounted his history with technology and his admiration for Lenovo as a company that dares to try new things. (With Shakira working with T-Mobile and Alicia Keys at BlackBerry , I probably shouldn’t be surprised when tech companies nab celebrity mascots. )
