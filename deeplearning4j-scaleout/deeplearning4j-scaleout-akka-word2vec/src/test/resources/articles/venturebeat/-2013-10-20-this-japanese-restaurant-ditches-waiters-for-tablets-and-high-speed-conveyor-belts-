The human waiter is the thing of the past — at least at one Japanese restaurant.
While conveyor belt sushi restaurants are a common sight in Japan nowadays,  the BCC recently took a look at a restaurant in Tokyo that lets customers order food via tablets placed at their tables, eliminating the need for waiters.
There’s analytics here as well. Using a variety of sensors, the kitchen can at a glance tell how many people are eating at one time, and use that data to figure out what dishes are most likely to be in demand.
More, while traditional conveyor belt sushi restaurants count the number of plates at a table to determine the final bill, this restaurant calculates the amount automatically when customers dispose of their plates via slots at their tablets.
But the post-human geniuses in Japan haven’t figured out how to rid their eateries of mortal staff entirely just yet. In in addition to flesh-and-blood kitchen staff, the restaurant also employs human cashiers, who certainly add a much-needed human element to the whole dining experience.
