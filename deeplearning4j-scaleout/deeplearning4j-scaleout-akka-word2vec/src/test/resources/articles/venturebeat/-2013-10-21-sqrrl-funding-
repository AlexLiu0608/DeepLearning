Sqrrl wants to help regular private-sector enterprises take advantage of the majorly scalable and powerful NoSQL database created by the National Security Agency.
The company, which was created by contributors to that NSA database project, received $5.2 million in funding today.
The NSA database was called Apache Accumulo and was created in 2008. It needed to be fast; it needed to be strong enough to sort through petabytes of data; it needed to scale based on all that data coming in; it needed to be “flexible, allowing people to come in and run analytics on that data; and it needed to be utterly secure.
The NSA successfully made it, open sourced it in 2011, and now Sqrrl want to be a part of bringing it to your business.
Data, if you didn’t know it already, is incredibly valuable when analyzed correctly. It can give you information about your customers, your products, your industry, anything. But collecting and storing that information — especially for those companies that have a lot of data to store — is expensive and sometimes difficult.
Sqrrl’s product has been used by the security industry, energy industry, finance industry, government agencies, healthcare institutions, and telecommunications companies. It was founded in 2012 and has offices in Cambridge, Mass. and Baltimore, Md.
The funding for this first round came from Atlas Venture and Matrix Partners.
