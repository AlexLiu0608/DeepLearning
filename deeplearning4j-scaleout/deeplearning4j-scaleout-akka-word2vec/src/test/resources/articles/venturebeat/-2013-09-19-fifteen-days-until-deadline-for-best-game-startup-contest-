Step right up. It’s time to apply.
Back for its fifth year, the Who’s Got Game Innovation Showdown will spotlight ten companies — from young startups to more established players — with the freshest ideas and most disruptive technologies in gaming.
This is your opportunity to showcase your product/service in front of 500 plus industry execs, investors, and press.
7 Finalists will have four minutes to present live at GamesBeat 2013. Our team of judges — made up of gaming industry experts & venture capitalists — will provide feedback on the products/services presented and determine a winner based on the following criteria:
» Freshness
» Innovation
» Potential for business success
The winner will be announced onstage and will receive VentureBeat/GamesBeat coverage, introductions to investors and/or relevant potential experts in our network, and other prizes yet to be announced.
The application deadline is October 4th, 2013 at 5pm PST.
Additional guidelines/rules:
- We suggest you submit a short video telling us more about your company or product with your application. This should not be an elaborate production. We are just looking for a no frills video of the entrepreneur or executive talking clearly about the idea.
- A person from your company (ideally the person in the video) must be available to pitch live at GamesBeat 2013.
- We do not allow powerpoints. Instead you can do a live demo, video, or other creative ways of presenting your technology.
- We’ll accept products that haven’t even been launched yet, and in fact we encourage this, and prioritize this.
