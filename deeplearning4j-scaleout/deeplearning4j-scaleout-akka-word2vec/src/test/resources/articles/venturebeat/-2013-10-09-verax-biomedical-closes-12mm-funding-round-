Funding supports ongoing commercialization of Platelet PGD®       Test; positions company for significant expansion and market growth in       2014
MARLBOROUGH, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 9, 2013–
Signaling its intent to capitalize on the opportunity for its Platelet       PGD® test for the detection of bacteria in       platelets, Verax       Biomedical announced today that it has completed a $12 million       financing that will position the company for aggressive growth in 2014.       This financing will also accelerate the completion of and clinical       studies for an improved version of its bacterial contamination test.       Both products are designed to address a significant and potentially       lethal bacterial contamination risk in transfused platelets.
The additional funding will position the company to meet market demand       created by increased focus by regulators, blood bankers and hospitals on       the risk of bacterial contamination in platelets, the anticipated       release of the company’s second product, an improved version of its       Platelet PDG® test, and further expansion in overseas       markets. The funding round was led by the company’s current venture       capital investors. It will also fuel an expansion of the company’s research & development efforts already under way with the recent move of       their corporate headquarters and laboratories to a larger facility in       Marlborough, Mass.
“We are very grateful for the on-going support of our current investors.       This additional financing will permit Verax to aggressively capitalize       on the opportunity present with our existing product and it sets the       stage for the introduction of our improved test that will offer       significant advances in performance and ease of use,” said James       Lousararian, Chief Executive Officer at Verax Biomedical.
The Platelet PGD® Test was developed by Verax Biomedical of       Marlborough, Mass. Published studies demonstrate that bacterial       contamination in platelets is the greatest infectious threat to       transfusion safety and that the Verax test offers a significant advance       in patient safety when used to address that risk. Over 100 hospitals in       the U.S. and Europe, particularly those that specialize in treating       cancer, have already adopted the Verax Platelet PGD® Test as       a safety measure for their platelet inventory.
Blood centers perform culture tests for bacteria in apheresis platelets       24 hours after donation, analyze results and dispose of contaminated       units. But platelets have a five-day shelf life and bacteria levels just       24 hours after donation may be too low for detection by culture. Studies       show that early culture testing misses an estimated three of every four       bacterially contaminated units, which are then released to hospitals for       transfusion.
The Verax Platelet PGD® test is a rapid immunoassay that       detects antigens present on the surface of bacteria. It is used at the       point of care, usually a hospital transfusion service laboratory, within       24-hours of transfusion when bacteria, if present, will be at higher       levels and easier to detect. The test was cleared by U.S. regulators in       2007 for detecting bacterial contamination in leukoreduced apheresis       platelets and in 2009 for use with whole-blood derived platelets. In       2011, the FDA cleared the test as a “Safety Measure” for leukoreduced       apheresis platelets. All other bacterial contamination tests for       platelets currently cleared by the FDA are cleared only as Quality       Control tests.
In the United States, more than 85 percent of platelets transfused are       collected via apheresis, an automated process by which one or more doses       of platelets are collected from a single donor. The remaining platelets       used for transfusion are primarily collected from whole blood donations,       a manual process in which a partial platelet unit is collected (along       with other blood components) and pooled from four to six different       donors to generate a therapeutic platelet dose.
