Developer PopCap’s vegetation-based tower-defense game is no longer tied down in exclusivity to Apple’s iOS devices or hidden away only for Android users in the land down under.
PopCap and publisher Electronic Arts released Plants vs. Zombies 2: It’s About Time for Android worldwide early this morning. It was previously available only on iOS, which it debuted on globally in August. Earlier this month, EA did a soft launch on Android in Australia in New Zealand.
Plants vs. Zombies 2 is a free download through the Google Play market and features in-app purchases for powerups and items that speed up advancement. It has players cultivating a garden full of sentient flowers, herbs, and shrubs that will give up their lives to fight off waves of shambling undead corpses.

Since its release, gamers have downloaded Plants vs. Zombies 2 more than 25 million times . In fact, it reached that number in just two weeks.
PopCap released the original Plants vs. Zombies for PC in 2009. It eventually spread to a number of other platforms, including mobile, Xbox Live Arcade, and Nintendo DS. Unlike the latest release, the studio charged an up-front fee for the game and did not include any in-game items for purchase.
