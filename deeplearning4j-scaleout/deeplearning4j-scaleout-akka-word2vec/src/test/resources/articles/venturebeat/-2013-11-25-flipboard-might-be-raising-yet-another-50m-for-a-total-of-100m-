Digital magazine app Flipboard might be raising slightly more than the $50 million funding amount  that we first heard rumors about back in September.
Apparently, the startup is in the process of closing another $50 million in funding as a continuation of that initial $50 million, according to a Fortune report that cites unnamed sources familiar with the deal. The initial $50 million funding rumor put Flipboard’s valuation at around $800,000, according to previous reports.
If true, the new funding would make Flipboard one of the best funded news-aggregating digital magazine services — with $160 million. The company’s service currently competes with a handful of competitors, including Zite, Pulse News, News360, and more . But one thing Flipboard does have that others trail behind is traction. Flipboard currently has 85 million monthly readers , and it recently launched a new catalog feature .
As for the funding, the new $50 million portion of this follow-on round is being led by Rizvi Traverse Management, according to Fortune’s sources. Others reportedly participating include Goldman Sachs, Index Ventures, Insight Venture Partners, and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.
We’re reaching out to Flipboard for confirmation about the new funding and will update this post with any new information.
