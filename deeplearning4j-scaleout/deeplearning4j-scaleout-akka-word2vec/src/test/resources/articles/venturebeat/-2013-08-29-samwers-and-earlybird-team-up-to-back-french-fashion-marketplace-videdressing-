The Samwers’ new $200 million investment fund Global Founders Capital has notched up another deal: an undisclosed sum for French secondhand fashion marketplace Videdressing , which raised a $6 million Series A round in March 2013 .
Videdressing, launched in 2009 by Meryl Job and Renaud Guillerm and based in Paris, is an online peer-to-peer marketplace for previously owned clothing and accessories, with a focus on high-end items and a free returns policy . The company claims to have increased transaction volumes fivefold during 2012, with more than 500,000 items listed.
The new funding is an extension of the previous Series A round rather than an entirely new Series B round and will go towards internationalisation, with a launch in Germany planned for the beginning of September. It’s a competitive market. As well as eBay and all the firsthand online options, rival secondhand marketplaces  Kleider Kriesel and Glamloop  also recently raised funding ( $6.5m from Accel Partners and an  unknown sum from Capnamic Ventures, OP Ventures, and Holtzbrinck Ventures ).
Global Founders Capital partners Oliver Samwer, Marc Samwer, and Fabian Siegel are a logical fit if Videdressing hopes to expand quickly. The Samwers are known for aggressively rolling out copies of existing business models into new markets; Siegel co-led global food ordering platform Delivery Hero during a crucial period of expansion.
Both Global Founders Capital and Earlybird Capital, which co-led the Series A round with DN Capital and Piton Capital, are based in Germany. It’s the first time the two firms have worked together – another sign of consolidation and new co-operation in the local industry .
Also today, Global Founders Capital announced an investment in UK dress rental company GirlMeetsDress . Again, no terms were disclosed but the company said it had committed “more than $5m” across its last three deals (GirlMeetsDress, Videdressing, Lingoda ).
