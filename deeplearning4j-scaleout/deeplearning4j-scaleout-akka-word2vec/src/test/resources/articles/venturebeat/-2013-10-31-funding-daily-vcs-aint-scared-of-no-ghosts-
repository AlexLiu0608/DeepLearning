Even on Halloween, the tech investment world is not scared. I personally know this to be true because I’m writing our Funding Daily column, which includes funding announcements for several new companies and investment funds.
Unfortunately, there’s nothing really scary about any of the startups mentioned below — just talk of mobile shopping, wireless LTE fragmentation fixes, big data, and more. There is, however, lots of awesome news that was made possible by dead presidents (sort of).
Check it out below…
Primary Data raises $50M: It’s all about the data, not the storage
A stealthy startup called Primary Data is aiming to deliver storage that isn’t hampered by those issues, and a healthy $50 million round of venture capital should help a bit. Investors with enterprise credibility participated in the round, including Accel Partners, Battery Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Wing Venture Partners. The Cedar Fund, an existing investor, also joined the round. Read the full story on VentureBeat .

Touting a technology that promises to increase the capacity of wireless networks,  Kumu Networks just snagged $15 million in a funding round led by Third Point Ventures with participation NEA and Khosla Ventures. Read the full story on VentureBeat .
Montage Ventures raises $8M for new investment fund
Montage Ventures, a presumably new venture capital firm with little online presence at this time, has raised $8 million toward a new investment fund, according to an SEC document filed today. The firm is based out of Menlo Park, Calif. and lists Todd Kimmel as the primary contact. Kimmel’s AngelList profile lists him as the managing director, and also that he’s looking for early-stage companies that haven’t raised much funding. The SEC doc shows that the fund is seeking a total of $25 million.
Contego gets $1.4M to save your business from fraud with software
Contego wants to make sure that business or person you’re about to hire on isn’t a fake or a risky move. Contego nicely calls its product “due diligence software” — the program that’s going to tell you if there’s any reason why you shouldn’t hire this person or use that company’s service. Contego is based in Oxfordshire and was founded in 2010. The company has taken on a total of $2.2 million to date. Investors include London Business Angel Investors, the Rainbow Seed Funding, the Angel CoFund, Cass Entrepreneurship Fund, and other investors. Read the full story on VentureBeat .
Dapper Shopping raises $500K
A company going by the name of “Dapper Shopping Inc.” raised $500,000 in funding, according to an SEC document filed today. I wasn’t actually able to glean much information about the business, as there doesn’t seem to be anything officially available yet. Dapper CEO Amir Malayery, who’s listed as the business contact in the filing, did however list that he had joined a “mobile shopping startup,” according to his LinkedIn profile. Dappershopping.com redirects to a splash page where you can sign up to be notified when it “launches.” The company likely has something to do with shopping and target men’s fashion. I’ve reached out to Malayery, who was unavailable for comment.
