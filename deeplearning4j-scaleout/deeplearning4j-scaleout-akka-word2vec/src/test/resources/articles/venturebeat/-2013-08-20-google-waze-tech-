The public saw the first evidence of Google’s integration with Waze’s crowdsourced traffic app in Google Maps today. And, Google shared a bit of its own technology with Waze’s still-living app as well.
Waze collects information about traffic and accidents from its users, compiling hopefully the most accurate and up-to-date picture of driving conditions on the road. Google acquired the Israeli company in June , and the purchase price was never officially revealed, though it was reported at a huge $1.3 billion.
You can find information about a number of possible traffic problems including accidents, road closures, and construction in Google’s mobile version of Maps for both Android and iOS, as noted by All Things D. This information is all supplied by Waze users and can be found in the traffic section of Google Maps.
Waze users contributing information to Google Maps are located in a host of different countries including Germany, Mexico, Peru, Colombia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Waze, which has kept its doors open since the Google acquisition is getting some love from Google’s technology as well. This includes Google’s famous Street View, which lets you see images of the area you are searching for on a map.
The Federal Trade Commission is still looking into the acquisition, despite the fact that it already occurred. After Google bought Waze, people came out in concern that the two would form a mapping monopoly in the industry.
