There are lots of things Mark Zuckerberg does well, but making inspirational videos is not one of them. Let’s all take a minute to remember when Facebook was a chair .
But Zuckerberg has released a three-minute video talking about his latest project to bring Internet access to more than five billion people. In August, he grabbed some partners and bought Internet.org to launch the initiative, which includes a “rough plan” Zuckerberg says he’s written out to make the Internet more accessible for folks all around the world.
The video starts off with calm music you’d likely find in a yoga studio because this. Is. Important. It shows pictures of farmers and people working the land around ancient ruins, women hanging laundry off balconies, and students sitting in non-traditional-by-Western-standards school houses. This is juxtaposed with Zuckerberg sitting in what can only be Facebook’s headquarters chatting about the first two pillars of his Internet revolution: changing the way data is stored and exchanged, and using wireless spectrum more efficiently.
If you have a phone, Zuck is going to connect you. If you don’t have a phone, well, maybe we figure out that problem later.
But while the video seems a little forced, the project is nothing to laugh about. He makes the valid point that when people are given access to the Internet, their available pool of knowledge grows exponentially (assuming they can read).
Zuckerberg ends the video asking us, “Ready?” with a title screen pointing to Internet.org. We can only expect to see more inspirational videos there.
