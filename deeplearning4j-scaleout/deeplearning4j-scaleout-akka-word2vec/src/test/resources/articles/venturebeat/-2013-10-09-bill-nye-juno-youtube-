What does putting together Bill Nye, YouTube, and NASA get you? A pretty awesome Friday night, if you ask me.
Nye, better known as Bill Nye the Science Guy, is back on the small screen to teach you about space. And he’s doing all of it through the THNKR YouTube channel.
This will take the form of an eight-part series called “ Why With Nye ” where he teaches anyone who will tune in about NASA’s “ Juno mission to Jupiter .” The series officially landed yesterday. NASA’s Juno is a spacecraft probe that is on its way to the big, gassy planet in order to study its atmosphere, magnetosphere, and its gravity. The probe was launched two years ago, but is finally starting its journey to Jupiter this month. It does this by flying by Earth and using our planet’s gravity as a slingshot of sorts, hurtling it toward Jupiter.
Of course, Nye explains all of this and how it works in his awesome videos.
Nye more recently has been a part of a number of “STEM” — science, technology, engineering, and mathematics — programs to get children interested in the sciences. He was a co-host of the White House’s annual science fair and more recently, well, competed on Dancing with the Stars — which, given this web series, is about as punny as it gets.
