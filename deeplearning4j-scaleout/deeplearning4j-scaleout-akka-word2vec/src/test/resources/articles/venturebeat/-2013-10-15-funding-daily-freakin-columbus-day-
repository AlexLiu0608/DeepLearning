You know how when there’s a Monday holiday and you come back on Tuesday to over nine thousand new e-mail and a to-do list longer than Jay-Z’s money?
That’s Funding Daily today. Yesterday, we had but two (2) funding stories — not enough to justify a roundup. As I told my boss, “Boss, you can’t have a roundup of two. Two’s a couple, three’s a crowd. Now four — that’s a roundup.”
He looked at me sternly.
Today, we have a grand total of 16 funding stories. Six. Teen. That’s not a roundup; that’s a cattle drive.
Moo:
Softtech VC is wishin’ and hopin’ for $85M
Looks like Silicon Valley venture firm SoftTech VC is looking to raise its fourth fund. The firm filed the fund with the SEC today. The fund will likely top at $85 million, if the filing is to be believed, though it doesn’t seem like the fundraising has been completed yet. This means that number could fluctuate. Jeff Clavier founded SoftTech VC in 2004. It has closed 150 rounds since then, including Fab, Fitbit, Poshmark, and SendGrid.
Logi Analytics fist-pumps for $27.5M round
Logi Analytics today announced its new $27.5 million round of funding.

The company’s product “provides clients the ability to analyze large volumes of data from disparate sources to make better business decisions and optimize performance.” The company says it’s a halfway point between big-button-bright-colors self-serve tools that are too simple and spendy business intelligence products that are too complex.

SundaySky puts $20M in a sarcophagus
It’s the age of social media and rich media, so big companies need better ways to easily connect to millions of customers in a way that seems human. Without, of course, actually incurring the expense of real live humans. SundaySky, which tripled revenues and doubled staff in 2012, just closed a $20 million third round of funding to accelerate its growth — and make more annoying videos with pepped-up muzak and personalized-but-not-personal video presentations of your health care bill, your insurance coverage, your mobile carrier’s new products, and everything else that you don’t want to spend your valuable time on.
