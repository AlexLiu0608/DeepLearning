Managing intellectual property can be a time-consuming process, especially for major enterprises with thousands of inventions, patents, and trademarks. That’s why companies like Microsoft, Ford, and Coca-Cola turn to Anaqua for help.
Anaqua, which just announced a $25 million investment from Bessemer Venture Partners, makes software that helps global enterprises file, manage, and protect their intellectual property. It sells the software-as-a-service (in the cloud) to more than 20,000 users, who use Anaqua to manage more than $500 billion in intellectual assets, according to the company.
“It’s always been challenging for businesses to manage IP and trademarks. But these days, it’s a strategic advantage to manage them well,” said Bob Goodman, a partner at BVP who will join Anaqua’s board of directors.
Anaqua’s software facilitates the patent management, filing, renewal, and monetization process.
In July, Anaqua received a “significant investment” from Insight Venture Partners, which  AllThingsD pegs at $100 million. The company is based in Boston, Massachusetts with offices in London, UK and Pau, France.
Bessemer Venture Partners manages $4 billion and has invested in companies like LinkedIn, Yelp, Skype, Pinterest, and Box.
