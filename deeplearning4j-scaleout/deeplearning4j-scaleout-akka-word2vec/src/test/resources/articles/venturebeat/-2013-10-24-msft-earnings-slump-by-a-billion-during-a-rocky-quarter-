Government fines, tablet failures, slumping revenues — that was old Microsoft from way back in June.
As of July, the company’s ready to tell a new story: triumphant tablet sales, growth both in consumer and enterprise products, and a mobile platform that’s sneaking up to its place at the table one inch at a time.
Especially if you look at year-over-year data, the Microsoft outlook (hah! pun) is bright.
After a tumultuous quarter in stock prices and news, Microsoft reports earnings were down from $19.9 billion last quarter to $18.53 billion as of the end of September but up from $16 billion year-over-year.
Gross margins grew from $11.8 billion for Q1 2013 to $13.4 billion this quarter. These results include a $1.36 billion revenue deferral for Windows 8.1 pre-sales.
The company recently started breaking its earnings down into commercial and consumer business. Here, we compare data quarter-over-quarter only.
The company’s consumer business grew 4 percent to $7.46 billion, up from around $7.2 billion last quarter.
Microsoft’s commercial services increased 10 percent to $11.2 billion year over year but were down from $12.7 billion last quarter.
From a statement on the news:
“Our devices and services transformation is progressing and we are launching a wide range of compelling products and experiences this fall for both business and consumers,” said Steve Ballmer, chief executive officer at Microsoft. “Our new commercial services will help us continue to outgrow the enterprise market, and we are seeing lots of consumer excitement for Xbox One, Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2, and the full spectrum of Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone devices.”
“We saw strong focus across our teams, generating record first-quarter revenue even as we navigate a fundamental business transition. Our enterprise renewals were very healthy and our devices and consumer business continued to improve,” said Amy Hood, chief financial officer at Microsoft. “We are making strategic investments in areas like technological innovation, supply chain management, and global cloud operations to build for the future and create long-term shareholder value.”
