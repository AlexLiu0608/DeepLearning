Hitman: Absolution — $4.99 (normally $25)
Not to be outdone, Green Man Gaming started their Winter Sale today as well. Games included in the sale get discounts up to 75% off instantly, and what’s more, the additional 20% off coupon stacks with the instant savings, yielding a maximum 80% discount. New deals are added every day, with savings lasting 24, 48, or 72+ hours. Today’s best deal is arguably Batman: Arkham Origins at a new low of $20 after coupon and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons for $6 . GMG is also throwing in a loyalty incentive of $0.10 of store credit per game purchased during their Winter Sales event.
On Amazon’s front, the online retailer is slapping discounts on PC download games through the end of the year . Any game you buy – irrespective of price – comes with a $5 credit you’ll be able to apply toward an Editor’s Choice Best Game of 2013 come January (list from Amazon forthcoming). We’ve assembled a list of current top picks (ten deals at time of writing), including the BioShock Triple Pack for $14.99 and a Borderlands 1 + 2 bundle for $11.99.
If you’re willing to step outside the Steam DRM, this week has also seen some great deals on EA’s Origin titles at GameFly . They’ve been running a digital EA games sale since yesterday, having given those titles up to 50% instant discounts and a stacking 20% off coupon code. Better still, if you buy any one game (DLC’s don’t count) they’ll throw in a FREE copy of Red Alert 3 for free. Not bad.
