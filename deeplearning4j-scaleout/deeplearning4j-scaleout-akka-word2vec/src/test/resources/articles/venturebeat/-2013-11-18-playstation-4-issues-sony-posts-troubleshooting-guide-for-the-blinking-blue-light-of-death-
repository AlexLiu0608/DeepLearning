Sony might feel like throwing a party for itself after revealing that it sold 1 million Playstation 4s on Friday , but it should probably hold off on any celebrations while some people are having issues with the new console.
A number of PS4 owners are reporting that their next-gen system is giving them a blinking blue light. Sony confirmed that pulsing blue glow indicates that the hardware is either not properly sending an audio/video signal to the television or something else is wrong with the console.
To help troubleshoot the “blinking blue light of death,” Sony posted a detailed guide on its forums  ( as first spotted by Joystiq ) that runs through a number of potential fixes.
The guide suggests PS4 owners try things like upgrading their television’s firmware, resetting the console’s power supply, and turning it on in safe mode. Even if the step-by-step instructions don’t get your PS4 fully working, it might help narrow down the cause of your particular issue.
Sony acknowledged the console had some issues in a statement it made prior to launch:
A handful of people have reported issues with their PlayStation 4 systems. This is within our expectations for a new product introduction, and the vast majority of PS4 feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We are closely monitoring for additional reports, but we think these are isolated incidents and are on track for a great launch.
There have been several problems reported, which leads us to believe there isn’t a singular problem that could impact a broader percentage of systems. The number of affected systems represents less than .04 percent of shipped units to date, which is within our expectations for a new product introduction.
If you tried the guide, and you’re PS4 still won’t work, you should probably try contacting Sony support directly at 1-800-345-SONY.
