Global Adoption of Social Media for Customer Engagement and       Relationship Management Drives Record Nimble Usage, Making it a Popular       Choice for B2B Professionals
SANTA MONICA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 8, 2013–
Today, Nimble , the pioneer in       social relationship management software, announced record growth as a       result of worldwide demand for social selling tools.
Highlights for the quarter include:
Greater than 2.5-times year-over-year growth in revenue from Q3 2012         to Q3 2013
Active Nimble users have grown by five times since January 2013
20 percent of users adopt a paid plan after their initial free trial
Q3 2013 Adoption and Growth
Last quarter, Nimble sign-ups       spanned 150 countries. Nimble Business saw its largest quarter to date       in paid subscribers, signing on its greatest number of new companies,       with 55 percent of these new accounts headquartered outside of North       America.
Social Selling with Nimble, Twitter and LinkedIn
Because up       to 70       percent of the business-to-business (B2B) buying process happens       online, companies are adopting social selling products like Nimble to       engage the new social customer. Recent studies show that Twitter and LinkedIn are named as the two top sites to engage       B2B prospects and sources for leads and customer research, which is       consistent with Nimble’s own traffic, which has nearly doubled from Q3       of 2012. Nimble makes working with both platforms easy, fun and       productive.
“We’ve been able to effectively change how we connect with customers,       thanks to the Nimble platform,” said Tiago Piava, CEO and co-founder of       award-winning startup TalkDesk. “The old, stale methods of selling don’t       work anymore, so we went looking for a tool that was built to leverage       social channels to connect with people that matter. This leads to more       relationships, more conversations we want to have and most importantly,       more revenue.”
Nimble has seen explosive uptake, especially from other exciting       companies such as Trendr , Little       Bird , Freshdesk , Grasshopper , Chirpify , Hirevue , Scalr , Visible       Gains and Gumroad , who see the       value of social selling.
“Businesses are getting smarter about the way they use social media to       connect with prospects and customers – whether they are engaging with       their customers for sales, marketing or service needs. Nimble is leading       the social selling movement by providing everything users need to       nurture and grow customer relations at a human level,” said Jon Ferrara,       founder and CEO of Nimble. “We just finished the most impressive quarter       in Nimble history, and we’re poised for even greater growth in the       future.”
