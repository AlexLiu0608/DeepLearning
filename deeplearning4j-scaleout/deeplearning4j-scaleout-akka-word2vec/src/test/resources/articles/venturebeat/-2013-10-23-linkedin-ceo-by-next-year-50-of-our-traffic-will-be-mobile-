SAN FRANCISCO — At a mobile-focused press conference today, LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner made some bold claims about his company’s quest to become a more modern, more mobile service.
Saying that 38 percent of LinkedIn’s traffic today comes from mobile, Weiner revealed that the company expects to be at 50 percent mobile traffic by next year.
This event, which Weiner called a “mobile moment,” has already happened in the UAE, Singapore, and Turkey. In Scandanavia, that figure is around 45 percent.
Also, Weiner said, LinkedIn mobile users are 2.5 times more active and engaged than desktop users. And the majority of revenue from sponsored updates, a new ad product launched just last quarter , already comes from mobile.
Weiner has previously said that his company plans to reach its goals of 3 billion profiles and a complete economic map of the world’s companies and workers in the long-term future. Today, he said that vision is entirely dependent on the company’s ability to scale on mobile.
If you’ve been keeping track of LinkedIn’s progress in mobile, you’ll have noticed a trend: Rapid iteration, powerful technologies, killer optimizations, and total reimaginings of what LinkedIn mobile apps should do and be. Today, company execs promised that reinvention will be a constant in LinkedIn’s present and future.
The company has indeed transformed itself into a beautiful, mobile butterfly , and it’s now going after a younger, even more mobilely motivated crowd .
We’ll have more details on exactly how this will be accomplished — and some big news — throughout the day, so stay tuned.
