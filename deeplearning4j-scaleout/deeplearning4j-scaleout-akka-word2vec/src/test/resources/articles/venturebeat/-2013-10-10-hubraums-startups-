Deutsche Telekom-backed  Hubraum  today kicked off the next round of its accelerator program in Berlin and revealed the seven startups taking part. The latest batch of teams includes health technology startups, an online education startup, a digital identity provider and a service that lets users monetize their own personal data.
Here’s a run-down of the seven participants:
EasyID: A digital identity service provider. By storing users’ ID details it provides quick and easy customer verification for businesses such as financial services, along with companies in the sharing economy.
Goderma : A web and mobile service that lets patients anonymously consult a dermatologist. They take a picture of their skin problem, answer medical questions, and receive a medical opinion within 24 hours.
OPTretina : A team of retina experts who evaluate digital photos of retinas and provide medical reports within 48 hours.
Pocket Aid : Helps patients use their waiting time at hospitals and doctors’ offices productively by getting them to fill in questionnaires about their medical history, earning rewards while doing so.
Primal Shield : Lets Internet users monetize their personal data — an Android app collects their data from their mobile and social network, using it for profiling and targeted ads.
StudyDrive : Encourages collaboration of knowledge to allows students to learn faster.
Lateral: Enhances online research and discovery with its UX-focused platform to boost the creative development of ideas.
The accelerator, which sits alongside an incubator programme, is a full-time, eight-week program that provides mentorship, expert support, and coworking space.
Hubraum launched in Berlin in 2012. It recently collaborated with two accelerators in  Tel Aviv  to bring early-stage Israeli companies to Berlin and  launched a program in Krakow  earlier this year. Startups who’ve previously participated in the accelerator in Berlin include  Vigour ,  Blinkist ,  Stylemarks, and Changify.
