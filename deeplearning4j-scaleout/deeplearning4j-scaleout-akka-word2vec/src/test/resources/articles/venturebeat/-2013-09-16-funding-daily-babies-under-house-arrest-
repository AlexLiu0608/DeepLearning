As usual, we’ve got a wide range of funding stories for you today. There’s the typical mix of content/social/enterprise startuppery, but our fave for Sept. 16 is a baby ankle bracelet for you to keep tabs on your infant. ‘Cause she’s probably got this whole secret life that you know nothing about.
Kids grow up so fast these days.
On with the show!
Upworthy closes $8M
Editorially curated content startup  Upworthy  has secured a new $8 million round of funding to help grow its service, the company announced today. The round may seem large for what’s essentially a content/media startup, and indeed it is. But Upworthy has released plenty of traffic stats that show its model for making “worthy” content go viral is working. The company said it has about 5 million subscribers and brings in nearly 22 million unique visitors per month. And back in June, Upworthy hit a  milestone 30 million unique visitors , as VentureBeat previously reported. Read the full story on VentureBeat .
Convo gets $5M
Convo  just raised its first significant round of funding as it attempts to build its own Facebook for the enterprise.

Sproutling raises $2.6M
Sproutling, maker of a wearable baby monitor, has popped out of stealth mode with $2.6 million in funding from Lemnos Labs (the hardware incubator that birthed it), First Round Capital, Forerunner Ventures, FirstMark Capital, and others. The hardware itself is a small sensor that attaches to the baby as an ankle bracelet — so great for “house arrest” jokes. There’s also a camera, a base station, and a mobile app.
PushPage seals $1.7M deal
Boston-based PushPage has taken a $1.7 million funding round. The web and mobile service lets you learn about people in your world via personal interviews/questions and highly visual responses. PushPage currently has around 5,000 beta users, including a scad of celebrities, the founder tells us. The service is officially launching today.
