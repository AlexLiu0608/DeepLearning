Shut. Up. Uber and GE are inundating San Francisco with DeLoreans, the iconic time-traveling car from hit sci-fi franchise Back to the Future. The cars will be hitting the streets for this weekend only.
For clarification, it is unclear whether Uber’s fleet of cars will actually be capable of time travel. We’re waiting to hear back from company reps on that one.
There are a few provisos and quid pro quos for this special offer, though. As previously mentioned, this is happening on this weekend only — that means between noon and 9 p.m. today and between noon and 6 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.
Also, only a handful of these cars are available, so you have to get lucky on timing to see the DeLorean option on your phone (see below). And forget joy-riding with your homies for hour after endless hour around the Mission; these cars can handle one passenger at a time, and your ticket to ride will expire after 15 minutes.
So bring your camera and get ready for a great story to tell your friends later. Now make like a tree and get outta here.
