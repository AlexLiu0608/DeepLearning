Square acquired photo sharing app Viewfinder today, which was attempting to build a private social network that let you send photos and later retract access rights if you want.
In what is effectively its goodbye letter , Viewfinder focuses on Square’s engineering team and the culture it has built for that segment of the company. It waxes on about how great the Square team is at creating solutions to payment problems that you never thought could be solved. So, it sounds like the company isn’t being acquired necessarily for its photo-sharing technology, but rather for its engineering talent.
Viewfinder was founded by two former Google employees and existed as a hybrid privacy-first social network and photo sharing app. The company let you share photos into the network, but then revoke the access if you don’t want people to see the pictures anymore. The technology doesn’t seem to immediately fit into Square’s payment processing business, but you never know where a “social component” will pop up next.
The company, which is currently based in New York, says it will be staying there to help Square build out its office in what Viewfinder calls, “the greatest city in the world.”
Viewfinder says “existing users will still be able to use the Viewfinder app for the time being, although we will no longer be releasing updates or providing customer feedback.” Translated, that means the product will likely shut down once the team gets officially absorbed.
Terms of the acquisition were not announced.
