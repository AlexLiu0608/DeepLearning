GoPro is making it easier to broadcast your own sports exploits with its lighter and smaller Hero3+ line of video cameras. You just attach them to your head and show your friends a video of you bungee jumping or barreling down a ski slope.
Sports video cameras have taken off now that bikers, skiers, and other action enthusiasts have figured out how to attach digital cameras to their helmets or other gear so that they can broadcast live video of their exploits.
The GoPro Hero3+ line, which I saw last week at the Pepcom holiday gift event in San Francisco, features 20 percent smaller and lighter designs and a 30 percent improvement in battery life compared to past models. It has a waterproof housing and shoots high-definition 1080p video at 60 frames per second, 2.7K at 30 frames per second, or 720p at 120 frames per second.
The WiFi transfers video about four times faster than prior models. it has a SuperView mode that has a wide-angle perspective. You can clamp the GoPro cameras to a variety of objects or wrap it around your chest on a harness. You can strap it to your head and then control it using your smartphone.
The devices have better lenses and new video capture modes, all aimed at making GoPro devices easier to use. The GoPro devices are now available at retailers for $199 to $400. Prices vary depending on the quality of video capture you want.
GoPro makes it easy to mount a wide-angle camera on a helmet or other part of your body. An average of three GoPro “tagged” videos are uploaded to YouTube every minute. The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences recently awarded the Hero3 camera, the predecessor, an Emmy for its contributions to filmmaking.
