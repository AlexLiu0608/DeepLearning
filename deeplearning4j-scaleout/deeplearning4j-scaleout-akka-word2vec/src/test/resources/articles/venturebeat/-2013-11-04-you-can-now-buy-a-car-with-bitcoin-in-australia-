According to Brim, using Bitcoin reduces costs, since the company uses it to pay overseas suppliers without incurring currency trade and transaction costs. All purchases, however, still do include Australia’s goods and services tax.
Tomcar’s sales are online, as the company has made the strategic decision to avoid add costs via an extensive dealer network. When a buyer selects Bitcoin as his or her currency of choice, the Bitcoin exchange rate is calculated in realtime and the transaction goes through a payment gateway supplied by CoinJar. That avoids any problem such as a crash in the value of Bitcoin, which could then bankrupt Tomcar.
“The Bitcoin economy is here. It’s becoming an increasingly mainstream currency, with companies such as WordPress and Chinese internet giant Baidu accepting it. Australia is one of the largest markets for Bitcoin users outside the US, and it makes excellent sense to respond to that growing demand,” says CoinJar co-founder Asher Tan said in a statement.
Bitcoin is increasingly penetrating the mainstream payment ecosystem. Last week the first Bitcoin ATM in the world opened up in Vancouver, Canada.
