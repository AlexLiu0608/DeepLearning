Showcasing innovation. Inspiring change.
With recent advances in health information technology, we stand at an unprecedented time for transition and opportunity in health care. Health care providers, entrepreneurs, and innovators are leveraging health data, mobile health, 3D printing, electronic health records, health information exchange, and social media to advance care and improve the patient experience and outcomes.
Health tech innovation will take center stage in New York City this Nov. 14-Nov. 15 at the  New York eHealth Collaborative’s   Digital Health Conference  as a “who’s who” of New York’s health IT ecosystem gather to network and discuss healthcare’s revolutionary transformation through technology.
