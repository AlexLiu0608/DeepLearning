SEATTLE–(BUSINESS WIRE)–November 12, 2013–
5BARz       International Inc. (OTCBB: BARZ) (Berlin: O5B), a technology leader       in the cellular network extender industry, announced today the       completion of a private placement, resulting in net proceeds of       $2,610,000. The Company issued 26,100,000 units, at a price of $0.10 per       unit, with each unit comprised of one share of the common stock of the       issuer and one share purchase warrant to acquire a second common share       at a price of $0.30. The warrant is exercisable for a period of two       years.
After more than five years of development, and approximately $13 million       of capital invested, the Company’s commercialized technology is being       recognized as a solution to improve cellular connectivity. This       recognition is facilitating a broad expansion of the Company’s       opportunities in terms of market integration as well as attracting the       capital resources necessary to continue executing the Company’s business       strategy.
“This capital injection allows us to accelerate the completion and       delivery of our second-generation device that is being designed to work       on the frequency of a major global network carrier, with over 150       million mobile subscribers. We believe that this product will ultimately       be adopted by network carriers around the world as the preferred       solution in the industry. While our first-generation device, the Road       Warrior, was a technology breakthrough in its own right and winner of a       prestigious design and engineering award at the 2010 CES, our       second-generation device will have features never seen before in our       industry. We look forward to delivering this second-generation device       for testing and qualification by our partners at the beginning of the       new year,” said Daniel Bland, CEO of 5BARz.
There is an increasing need in the market for cellular network extenders       as consumers clamor for improved cellular connectivity. 5BARz is       uniquely positioned to lead this path, with a patented technology that       incorporates the Network Protection Standard Requirements recommended in       the recent FCC ruling, making the Company’s product both user and       network friendly.
