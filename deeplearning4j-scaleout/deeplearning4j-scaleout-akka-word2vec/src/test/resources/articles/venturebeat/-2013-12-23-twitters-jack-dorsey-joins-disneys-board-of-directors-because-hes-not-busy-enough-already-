Twitter chairman and Square CEO Jack Dorsey wears a lot of hats — and now he’s putting on one more.
Disney announced today that Dorsey has joined its board of directors . While it seems like an odd move, Disney CEO Robert Iger said that Dorsey’s appointment was all about leveraging some of those social media smarts the Twitter co-creator has picked up over the years.
“The perspective he brings to Disney and its board is extremely valuable, given our strategic priorities, which include utilizing the latest technologies and platforms to reach more people and to enhance the relationship we have with our customers,” Iger said in a statement.
With the move, Dorsey joins fellow tech company heads like Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and former Sybase CEO (and interim BlackBerry CEO) John S. Chen, who joined Disney’s board in 2010 and 2004, respectively.
Considering that Dorsey is already worth over a billion dollars and helps run two companies, it’s a safe bet that he’s not joining Disney for the money. (Though the money probably helps.)
