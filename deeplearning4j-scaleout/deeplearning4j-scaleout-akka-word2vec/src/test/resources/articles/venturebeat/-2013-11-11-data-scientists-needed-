Data scientists are the people who can understand and provide meaning to the piles and piles of data that companies collect and keep nowadays. “Big data” is the buzzword that represents those piles — tons of information about customers, products, and habits, that may one day help people sell advertising, build better merchandise, or even save lives.
But they can’t do any of that if there isn’t a data scientist who can look at the data and say, “This is important. Check out this trend.”
Between 2010 and 2020, the data scientist career path is projected to increase by 18.7 percent, beat only by video game designers. The big data industry is expected to be a 53.4 billion industry by 2016, as per the infographic below.
And if you’re only just deciding on a college education, Stanford, Northwestern University, and the University of California San Diego offer data science degrees. UC Berkeley just added a data science course to its virtual classroom .
