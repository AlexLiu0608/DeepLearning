Two thirds of (upgradeable) Apple mobile devices running iOS 7 today
With Apple holding a dominating — but declining — 32 percent of the worldwide tablet market, today’s announcement is a critical one for the company. Will it be able to hold on to its market share against Android tablets, led by Samsung, which has 18 percent (and has more than doubled its share in the past year)? Note: Apple’s iPad still commands 81 percent of North American tablet usage , and typically iPad usage (as opposed to unit sales) far outstrip that of competing Android tablets.
Complicating things for the company is the fact that Microsoft’s new Surface and Surface Pro tablets start shipping today, and Nokia (which Microsoft is in the process of acquiring) has just released its own Windows RT-based tablet this morning.
