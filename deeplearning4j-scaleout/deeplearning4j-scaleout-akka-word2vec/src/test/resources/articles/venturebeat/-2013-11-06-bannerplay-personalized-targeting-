BINYAMINA, Israel–(BUSINESS WIRE)–November 6, 2013–
BannerPlay, a leading provider of advertising technologies for small and       medium businesses, launches a personalized targeting advertising service       for small budget campaigns. BannerPlay personalized targeting for SMBs is a “must have” advertising tool for online advertisers. Using the       personalized targeting service, BannerPlay’s advertisers can now create       lists of users visiting their site or participating in their campaigns       and reach out to these users with dedicated campaigns.
BannerPlay offers the small business personalized retargeting service as       an integral part of its advertiser campaign plans, enabling advertisers       from any size to create and target specific campaigns towards users who       already have visited their sites and/or clicked on previous campaigns.       BannerPlay’s personalized targeting adds the element of time to the       campaigns, turning them from a simple campaign to recency activity. Thus       making it possible for advertisers to market their products in a most       productive way, deciding not only who sees the campaign and where but       also when.
Rafi Ton, CEO of BannerPlay, said: “Advertisers move from campaign to       recency activities, which prove to be much more effective. Small and       medium businesses need to be efficient and cost effective when       advertising online. We offer personalized targeting because it is       clearly an opportunity to reach an interested consumer where and when he       is most receptive. When you combine innovative advertising technologies       together with solid behavioral data, you can give SMBs a real ROI for       their campaign budget and the edge they were looking for with big ad       agencies.”
Together with the BannerPlay studio, advertising web-apps and real-time       analytics, advertisers can now tailor their display banner ads to       specific specials or eye-catching selling points such as discounts or       special offers that can encourage those visitors to come back to their       website, and ultimately finalize the purchase process.
