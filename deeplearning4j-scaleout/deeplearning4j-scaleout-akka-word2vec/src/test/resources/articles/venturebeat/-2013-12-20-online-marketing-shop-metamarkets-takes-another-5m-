MetaMarkets CEO Mike Driscoll told VentureBeat via email, “In order to support the company’s rapid growth, we reopened our last round of funding to our existing investors. It was a relatively small amount, but enough to help us continue to focus on accelerating our business without making the time commitment required by raising a new round of funding.”
