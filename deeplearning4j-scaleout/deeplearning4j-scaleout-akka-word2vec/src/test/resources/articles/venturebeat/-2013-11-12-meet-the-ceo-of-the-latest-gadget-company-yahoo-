Come January, one of the prime keynotes at the biggest gadget show in America will be the chief executive of Yahoo.
The Consumer Electronics Association announced today that Yahoo CEO (and Vogue fashion model ) Marissa Mayer will deliver a keynote at its 2014 International CES, aka the show formerly known as the “Consumer Electronics Show.” She’ll deliver a speech at 1 p.m. on Tuesday, January 7, 2014, just as the show proper is kicking into high gear (but a day or two after most of the show’s product announcements hit the media).
Is Yahoo a gadget company? Who cares? “As a defining innovator making waves in the online and mobile space and a fresh breath for the industry, Marissa Mayer is a perfect addition to our Tech Titans keynote series,” said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of CEA, in a statement. “We’re thrilled to welcome her to the CES stage to share her strategic vision for the evolving tech landscape.”
Plus, she’s a woman, and we don’t have too many of those onstage at CES, Shapiro didn’t add.
Besides, what do you think people take all those Flickr photos with? Gadgets, that’s right! Which is probably why Mayer recently told investors that Yahoo’s future is mobile .
Of course, that’s something almost any Internet company CEO could tell you.
