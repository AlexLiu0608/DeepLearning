Flurry  will provide analytics and other app services to 37,000 South Korean developers as part of a partnership with SK Planet ‘s T Store, the mobile app store of SK Telecom.
The deal is important to San Francisco-based Flurry as it expands overseas and enters the world’s most competitive mobile market, South Korea. Flurry provides analytics to more than 125,000 companies and 400,000 mobile apps so that the developers can measure their audience reach, engagement, retention, and conversion of free players to paid users. In South Korea, the market for mobile devices is near saturation, according to Flurry.
Flurry reaches 1.2 billion devices worldwide, and its Flurry Analytics product already measures app activity across 33 million mobile devices in South Korea. Now, developers will be able to get a holistic view of both store performance and app usage. The T Store is launching its own developer center today and will invite developers to sign up to create a Flurry account. Once the developers install Flurry’s free software development kit (SDK) in their app, Flurry Analytics reports will appear in the developer center alongside app store download and revenue metrics.
“Flurry is a mobile-first company that understands the unique needs of mobile developers,” said John M. Park, senior vice president of platform product management for SK Planet, in a statement. “T store app developers will have seamless access to the tools they need to build the best mobile experiences for the Korean market. That suite of solutions would not be complete without Flurry’s market-leading Analytics product.”
“South Korea is the most advanced and innovative mobile nation in the world, making it an exciting place for app developers to build a business,” said Jarah Euston, vice president of analytics and marketing for Flurry. “We are honored by SK Planet’s endorsement of Flurry Analytics, and we look forward to helping more app developers delight Korean mobile consumers with high quality Android experiences.”
Flurry also published a report today that said 85 percent of the devices owned in South Korea are also manufactured there. And 41 percent of all South Korean connected devices are phablets, (phones and small tablets combined in one device) compared to just 7 percent of all devices worldwide. 
The installed base of connected devices grew 81 percent from August 2012 to August 2013. But South Korea, where most people already have mobile devices, grew only 17 percent. Samsung has about 60 percent share of the connected device market in South Korea.
Games are the most popular app category in South Korea, with 68 percent of revenue for SK Telecom’s app store coming from games. Gamers spend an average of $5.27 a month, compared to $2.92 per general user in the U.S. About 96 percent of apps used in South Korea are free.
