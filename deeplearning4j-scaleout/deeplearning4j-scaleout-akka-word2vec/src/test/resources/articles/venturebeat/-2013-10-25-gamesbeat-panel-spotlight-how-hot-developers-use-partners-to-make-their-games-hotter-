Susan Choe, managing director of Visionnaire Ventures, will moderate the session. Choe, pictured right, is running a new San Francisco-based fund aimed at pulling together interactive content companies, particularly in the games industry. She was previously the founder and CEO of Outspark, a free-to-play massively multiplayer online game publisher. She has also help top positions at NHN, Yahoo, and DLJ.
Some companies, like King and Supercell, have done that and become financial powerhouses. But behind the scenes, they need help to reach the largest possible audiences and to monetize.
We’ll have a main-stage panel session on this topic at our  GamesBeat 2013  conference. The event is Oct. 29-Oct. 30 at the Sofitel Hotel in Redwood City, Calif.
The panelists include: Maria Alegre, CEO of Chartboost; Jude Gomila, co-founder of Heyzap; Zach Phillips, vp of publisher development at PlayHaven; and Kristian Segerstrale, Supercell board member and co-founder of Initial Capital.

We’ve entered the Battle Royal, an era where many firms are vying for gamers’ time. Apple and Google want to get in the living room and are waging war against Nintendo and Sony. Microsoft already has an edge in living room entertainment with its Xbox Live service, but it wants a piece of mobile as well. It’s a confusing time for gamemakers. Where should they take their titles? Which platforms will provide the best experiences? Who will make them the most money?
Register here.
We’ll have a steady drumbeat of speakers as we get closer to GamesBeat 2013′s October date. We expect to have more than 80 of the gaming industry’s best lined up for our fifth annual event.
Each year, GamesBeat follows a big trend. In 2009, we focused on how “All The World’s a Game,” with the explosion of games on the global stage. In 2010, GamesBeat@GDC focused on “Disruption 2.0.” In 2011, our theme was “Mobile Games Level Up,” investigating the busy intersection of games and mobile technology. In 2012, we  explored “The Crossover Era ,” the time when so many big game companies and startups were transforming themselves by expanding from one market to the next. Our judges, meanwhile, are already busy picking the finalists in the Who’s Got Game Innovation Showdown for the best game startup.
As companies adapt to change, we’re witnessing disruption, adaptation, consolidation, innovation, and the arrival of big money. We’re talking billions of dollars that are at stake. We’re expecting 400 notables from throughout the game industry — social, mobile, online, and console. Please join us.
