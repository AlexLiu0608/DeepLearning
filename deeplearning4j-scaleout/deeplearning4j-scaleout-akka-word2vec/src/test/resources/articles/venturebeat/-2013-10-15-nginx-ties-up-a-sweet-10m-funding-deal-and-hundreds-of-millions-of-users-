Dev-tools company Nginx has just announced a hot new infusion of cash to the tune of $10 million.
The product, Nginx, is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server. I know, right?!
In lay-terms, that means Nginx is an incredibly fast web server. Between y’all and us, it powers a ton of household-name sites, such as Netflix, Facebook, and WordPress, to name but a few. The company says its biggest responsibility is to make the web faster.
The $10 million round was led by NEA and included participation from all Nginx’s existing investors: e.ventures, Runa Capital, and MSD Capital. Also, Box founder Aaron Levie participated in the round.
“Since launching Nginx Plus, its first commercial product, in August, [Nginx] already has over 100 customers,” a rep wrote in an email to VentureBeat today, also mentioning that the company counts its end users in the hundreds of millions.
The company will be using the money for a grand hiring spree — namely, hiring of sales and support team members to deal with customers, not so much more engineers and developers. Though we’re sure they wouldn’t turn down a handful of resumes from Silicon Valley’s finest.
This is just one in a string of high-profile success stories for open-source developer tools. Stay tuned for more; this is a great trend we don’t see dying down anytime soon.
