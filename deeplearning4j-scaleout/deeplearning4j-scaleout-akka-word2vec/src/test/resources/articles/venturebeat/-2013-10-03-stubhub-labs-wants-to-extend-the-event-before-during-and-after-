How many ways can people expand the experience of buying a ticket and attending an event? The  eBay-owned StubHub , which bills itself as the world’s largest ticket marketplace, aims to find out with its new StubHub Labs.
Announced first on VentureBeat, the Labs are charged with developing products for fans through rapid prototyping that tests what catches people’s attention. The idea is to develop not only pre-event apps, but ones for during and after as well. It’s all part of the general trend to stretch an event as far outward as possible – it’s no longer just the meal, but the anticipation beforehand, the logistics in getting there, and the reminiscing afterward.

Heading up the new Lab: 20-year mobile industry veteran Gary Kanazawa, who’s worked with Electronic Arts Mobile, Microsoft and THQ Wireless.
The first app is already out, and being piloted in the San Francisco area. Called ShowDrift and available for free in the Apple App Store , it is designed to help music and entertainment fans receive venue-oriented info about shows in a given vicinity.
Kanazawa told VentureBeat that the focus of the Labs is “enhancing the fan experience” primarily through mobile apps. To do that, his team will release products like ShowDrift and, through analysis of anonymous data, will iteratively determine what works and what doesn’t. “We’re looking at things much broader than discovery,” he said, such as fans’ transportation needs before a show or sharing their experience afterward.
