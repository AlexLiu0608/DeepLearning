HireVue wants to make you the star of your own job interview.
The company has closed $25 million for its “talent interaction platform,” which leverages video technology to streamline the recruiting process.
“How a person is screened, interviewed, hired, and onboarded hasn’t changed much in the last 100 years,” HireVue’s CEO Mark Newman told VentureBeat. “Most of the technology from the past decade dehumanizes candidates by reducing the quality and quantity of personal interactions they have with recruiters. At many companies, the human element has all but disappeared from the recruitment life cycle. HireVue makes recruiting personal again.”
HireVue’s core product enables digital interviews to help companies screen job candidates. The service makes interview questions available on demand so job seekers can answer them remotely and interviewers can listen at their convenience.
The newly released talent interaction platform augments HireVue’s existing platform with features for every stage of the recruiting process.
In addition to video screening and interviewing, HireVue now has a sourcing component that helps businesses find candidates through social media, email, and referrals. The validation section delivers multimedia questions, tests, and industry-specific evaluation tools, such as coding challenges, to ensure a candidate’s skills are up to snuff. Finally, once a person is hired, HireVue now offers them a way to introduce themselves to team members via video.
The goal is to help people applying for jobs become more than a name on a resume. Candidates have the opportunity to showcase their personality, while businesses can better understand if an applicant is a good cultural fit.
There is a lot of recruiting/hiring technology out there, but Newman said HirVue stands out for three reasons. First, the technology is versatile. It leverages trends in video, social, and mobile technology to put “people, their voices, and experiences back in the center of business.” Second, HireVue integrates with existing applicant tracking systems, as well as LinkedIn and Salesforce.  Finally, the company has seen strong momentum.
In the past year, HireVue has grown sales over 100% and quadrupled its staff. It’s now averaging more than one enterprise deal per day. More than 300 companies, now including 20% of the Fortune 100, use its technology. Customers include Walmart, Dow Jones, Dunkin’ Donuts, Geico, and Conoco Phillips.
Sequoia Capital led this round of funding, with participation from Kickstart Fund and existing investors. This is HireVue’s fourth found of funding, bringing its total capital raised to $53 million. The company is based in Salt Lake City, Utah.
