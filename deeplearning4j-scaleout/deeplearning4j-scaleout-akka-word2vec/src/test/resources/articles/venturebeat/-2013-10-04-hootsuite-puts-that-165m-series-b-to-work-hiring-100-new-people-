HootSuite is putting some of its recently raised cash to work. The enterprise social media management company turned in a massive $165 million funding round for international expansion, and it’s wasting no time using that money.
The company of 370 is attempting to increase its headcount by at least 30 percent, almost overnight.
“We’re in a period of major growth here at HootSuite, which means hundreds (seriously) of new job openings,” the company said today.

It doesn’t hurt that HootSuite has been rated not just one of the top but the top employer in its head office location in Vancouver, Canada, and that it has just recently moved into top-end new offices complete with a yoga studio (CEO Ryan Holmes is a fanatic), pup tent offices, and that must-have-accessory for the modern tech company office, a nap room.
In addition, HootSuite says it’s on the same growth curve as Evernote and Zendesk  and that it currently has over seven million users, with 79 of the Fortune 100 companies using its software.
But the company’s plans are much bigger.
“We absolutely can put the funds to work,” Holmes told me when we chatted after the company announced its $165 million funding in August. “Our goal is to build a multibillion company [and] we’re putting the money toward marketing and international expansion.”
The company is holding a “#HootHire” even on Tuesday at its office in Vancouver. Six hundred jobseekers attended its previous event in March of this year.
