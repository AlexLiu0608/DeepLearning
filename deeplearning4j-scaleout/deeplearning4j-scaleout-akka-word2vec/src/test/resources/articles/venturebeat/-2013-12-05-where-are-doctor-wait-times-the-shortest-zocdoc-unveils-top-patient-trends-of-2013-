ZocDoc dug into America’s “largest database of patient behavior” to discover the top patient trends of 2013.
ZocDoc makes it easy for people to book doctors appointments through its online booking service. More than 4 million patients use ZocDoc every month, and their interactions provide a wealth of data and insights that were never available before.
The 2013 “U.S. Health Checkup” (infographic below) found Austin is the most proactive city when it comes to overall health, booking the most preventative appointments.
San Francisco made the most dental appointments and, interestingly, Detroit made the most cosmetic appointments and had the most active mobile bookers. Seattle has the shortest in-office wait times.
ZocDoc also found that women rated doctors slightly higher than men and left more comments, while men rated doctors more often and were slightly more forgiving about wait times.
Most appointments booked online are between 11:30 am and noon, and men attended more night and weekend appointments. The most popular appointment times are weekdays at 10 am and 2 pm, and the most popular day to see a doctor is Tuesday.
Interest (and funding)  in health tech in surging right now, and there is a tremendous amount of innovation happening across the healthcare space.
We are seeing companies building “smart” mattresses for premature babies, iPhone plugins that take ear scans, and even mobile social networks for doctors.
Health and data is a key area of focus. Advancements in computing and big data, as well as genomics, electronic health records, and services like ZocDoc that put a part of the healthcare process online, are creating and capturing certain types of data for the first time.
This report about patient habits and preferences is interesting on its own. How else could we know that Denver residents book the most OB/GYN appointments?
However the real value is in helping physicians use this information to operate more efficiently and provide more convenience for their patients. Data is no longer “exhaust” that disappears into the air, but rather information that can be used to improve patient care and outcomes.
