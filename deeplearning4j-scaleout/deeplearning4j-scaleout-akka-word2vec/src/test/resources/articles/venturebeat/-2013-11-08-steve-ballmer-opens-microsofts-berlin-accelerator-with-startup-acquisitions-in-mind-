Amidst the media buzz over who will take over from Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, the man himself was in Berlin today to open the company’s tech hub and announce the startups in the first batch of the Microsoft Ventures Accelerator.
The tech hub sits prominently on Unter den Linden and includes a customer lounge, events area, meeting rooms, offices for Microsoft staff, and an entire floor dedicated to the startups.  High-Tech Gründerfonds and the investors from Seedcamp will also be moving into the center.
For four months, the startups in the accelerator will work on their business ideas with the IT giant, which will provide mentoring, connections to its network, and potential financing at the end of the program. At the moment, Microsoft has no shares in any of the companies.
Microsoft Ventures’ GM, Rahul Sood, said that they hope to evolve the ecosystem rapidly by improving the deal-flow in Berlin – the company wants to invest in and potentially buy the startups that come through its program. The team at Microsoft Ventures have pretty a lofty goal: working to become the “best accelerator in Europe” in the near future.
The nine startups
Attaching.it – Secure file transferring service
Babbo – A magazine, video and music recommendation service that’s individually tailored
Cringle – A mobile solution to repay friends quickly using your existing bank accounts
EvoMob – Platform to easily convert online shops to mobile shops
Makeapoint – A combination of video-calling and discussion boards to facilitate online debates
