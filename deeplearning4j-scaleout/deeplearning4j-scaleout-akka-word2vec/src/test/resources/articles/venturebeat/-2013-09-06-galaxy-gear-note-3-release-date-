If the Galaxy Gear’s bulkiness and lukewarm reception hasn’t scared you off yet, you’ll likely be able to get your hands on one at the beginning of October.
T-Mobile has announced that the Note 3 smartphone and Galaxy Gear will be available together on October 2, while AT&T says it will launch the Note 3 on October 1 (with the Gear set for the “coming weeks”). Both carriers will offer the Note 3 for $300 with a two-year contract, while T-Mobile will have the Gear for $300 (we can expect other carriers to follow suit).
Verizon still hasn’t announced the launch date for both devices, but according to leaked promo material , it will begin taking pre-orders today.
At launch, the Galaxy Gear will only function together with Samsung’s Note 3 smartphone, so it makes sense for carriers to try and launch them together. The Gear will eventually function with other Samsung Galaxy devices running Android 4.3 or higher, which includes the new 2014 edition of the Galaxy 10.1 tablet, as well as the Galaxy S4 later this fall.
Already, we can see Samsung’s restrictive connectivity for the Gear working against it. The 5.7-inch Note 3 will only appeal to a niche set of buyers, and with the Gear going for $300, even prospective Note 3 owners will likely think twice about picking up Samsung’s smartwatch.
