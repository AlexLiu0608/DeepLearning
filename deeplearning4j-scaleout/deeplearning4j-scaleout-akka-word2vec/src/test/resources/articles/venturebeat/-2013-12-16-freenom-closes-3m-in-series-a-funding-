AMSTERDAM–(BUSINESS WIRE)–December 16, 2013–
Freenom, the free domain name provider, announced today that it has closed $3M in Series A funding from a group of investors led by Kima       Ventures (KIMA), the most active angel investor in the world. Freenom       will use the funds to expand its top level domain management operations,       to expand its AnyCast cloud network and the development of commercial       initiatives combining country top level domains with local communities.
“Our current partners are very committed to the free domain name idea       and industry,” said Joost Zuurbier, CEO & Founder of Freenom. “We are       pleased to work with KIMA and the other members of this investment group       to accelerate our growth and to expand our technology and presence       online.”
One of KIMA’s Co-founders, Xavier Niel, is a French entrepreneur and       businessman, active in the telecommunications and technology industry       and best known as founder and majority shareholder of the French       Internet service provider Iliad, trading under the Free brand. The       management of Freenom recognizes his experience and know-how in freemium       business models as a valuable asset to the company.
Freenom is managing the registry operations for the TK (Tokelau), GA       (Gabon), CF (Central African Republic) and ML (Mali) top level domains.       With more than 20 million active domain names, Freenom manages the       largest domain name portfolio after .COM. Domains are provided for free       to individuals and businesses worldwide. These domains work as any other       paid domain. Websites with a free domain have no advertisements and can       be renewed at no cost.
Free domain name registrants are found everywhere, especially in regions       where the number of internet users is increasing rapidly. China and       Brazil are amongst the largest user groups of free domains. But also in       the local partner countries, like Gabon and Mali, free domains have       become very popular.
“The free domain name model radically changes the way a top level domain       registry operates. We help partner countries to transform paid domain       systems and processes into a new platform where domains are free and can       be registered by everyone, locally and abroad.” Zuurbier continues. “We       try to build truly win-win relationships with our partner countries. As       a result we’ve seen a huge increase of local website building and       technology usage locally, while providing the countries an additional       income stream and promotional exposure. KIMA’s investment allows us to       rapidly expand this platform, to reach out to additional countries and       to invest in new partner relationships.”
Revenue is generated by monetizing the expired domain names. Domains       that are no longer used by the registrant or are expired are taken back       by Freenom and the residual traffic is sold to advertisement networks.       Next to this primary source of income, additional revenue will be       generated by offering digital white labeled services, such as hosting       packages, SSL certificates and others, to free domain name users. These       new services will be available from January 2014 onwards.
Freenom found a safe way to provide free domain names to the global       internet community. Freenom operates a global network of more than 50       trusted partners that have implemented an API to take down domain names       immediately when these domains are allegedly involved in spam, phishing       or copyright infringement. Partners include Facebook, Twitter, Anti       Phishing Alliance of China and many others. As a result of this       initiative .TK, the largest country code top level domain, is seen as       one of the safest domains, according to a recent study of Architelos.
