Pacejet Logistics aims to simplify shipping by bringing together a disparate network of carriers and logistics services in one cloud-based solution.
Pacejet just closed a $4.5 million funding round led by Athenian Venture Partners, the company announced Monday. Earlier investors include several angels and employees, as well as Ohio state.
Powered by Amazon Web Services, the company’s shipping solution connects its clients (manufacturers and distributors) with carriers like FedEx, UPS, and the U.S. postal service to provide real-time rates and tracking through one central dashboard. It also automates some of the label production and paperwork associated with product shipping.
“This makes shipping easier and cheaper by eliminating the need for shippers to use multiple carrier websites and software applications to get the most accurate freight rates and service times,” said Ron Lee, Pacejet chief technology officer and co-founder, in an email exchange with VentureBeat.
Unlike legacy shipping software, Pacejet’s cloud-based solution doesn’t need to be maintained and updated on-site. Additionally, it integrates with enterprise resource planning systems like NetSuite, Infor SyteLine, and Plex (among others) to combat duplicate data entry.
The Columbus, Ohio-based company will use its newly raised capital to “increase its business development team, add additional sales and marketing resources, and expand the platform capabilities,” according to Lee.
Pacejet was founded in 2003 and currently has 30 employees.
