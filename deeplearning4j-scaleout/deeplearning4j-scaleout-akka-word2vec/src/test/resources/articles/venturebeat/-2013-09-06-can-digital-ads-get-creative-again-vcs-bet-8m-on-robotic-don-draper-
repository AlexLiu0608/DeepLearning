BoostCTR , a new kind of tool for online ads, has just raised an $8 million round of funding.
The startup focuses on “creative optimization,” which this company defines as a sort of robotic Don Draper, maybe minus some of the philandering and drunkery. Rather than focusing on placement and targeting alone, BoostCTR looks at tweaking ad copy and images to get better return on investment for advertisers.
This approach, company reps say, can lead to a 30 percent increase in clickthroughs as well as a 5 percent decrease in cost.
This is BoostCTR’s second round of institutional funding. The deal was led by Battery Ventures, with participation from existing investors Javelin Venture Partners and Western Technology Investment. Battery partner Brian O’Malley will be joining the BoostCTR board.
“In many instances, the messaging is an afterthought in digital marketing, which has become increasingly analytical and data-driven,” said BoostCTR CEO David Greenbaum in a statement on the news. “What we are doing is delivering human insight with the scale of software. It has shown to be the missing piece for sophisticated online advertisers.”
San Francisco-based BoostCTR was founded in 2009 and previously raised a $4 million first round of funding.
