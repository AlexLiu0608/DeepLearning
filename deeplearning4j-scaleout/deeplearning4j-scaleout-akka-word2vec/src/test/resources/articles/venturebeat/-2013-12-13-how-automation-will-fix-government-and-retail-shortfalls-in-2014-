With IDC saying that emerging markets will account for 35% of 2014 worldwide IT revenues and, for the first time, more than 60% of worldwide IT spending growth, it’s time for every business to really examine what their spends are and ultimately identify the redundancies in currently deployed technologies, processes that can and should be automated, and ultimately, be sure that every last cent can be spent effectively on innovating to stay ahead of the competition.
After speaking with experts across Cloud, Mobile, WebOps, and Retail, here are few ways you’ll see automation step-up and help right the wrongs from 2013 and streamline processes for everyone in the coming year.
The “Internet of Things” gets real
Much like Big Data, Cloud, and even BYOD, transformative IT trends have been democratized by the mainstream. With that, the fundamental urgency for connectivity and localized marketing has been heightened by customer demands. Yet enterprises are mystified on where to start. Hyper competitiveness and accelerating customer expectations will continue to drive organizations and the IT behind them such as embedded sensors, image recognition and NFC, to improve customer engagement and personalization. With the information floodgates free flowing, the Internet of Things will take actionable shape across all industries including healthcare, retail, energy and the public sector.
Enterprises will learn from government IT mistakes
Probably the most painful example to hit the global stage this year is Presiden’t Obama’s Healthcare.gov debacle. With recent government IT ailments and costly redundancies, enterprise IT investments will be under the microscope, making testing a top priority. In such cases, it’s necessary to treat the whole system as one heterogeneous unit from business to infrastructure in order to deliver a complete view of former siloed systems. Priority schedulers, operations, development—any changes made to the infrastructure—will need to be tested and rolled out consistently to eliminate the risk of disrupting the broader infrastructure.
Ringing up next generation shoppers
Ever thought that Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers would be year-round happenings? They just might be!
Today’s shoppers are a part of a new generation that’s more demanding, constantly connected and accustomed to the speed and simplicity of mobile and online shopping channels . With the current explosion of data that retailers are collecting from in-store, e-Commerce channels and social media, the process of predicting shifts in purchasing patterns will become second nature.
To cope with the level of information and uncover new revenue streams and ultimately more smartly incentivize shoppers, retailers will focus more on cross-channel customer consistency, streamline the supply chain, and localized messaging to maintain customer loyalty and stay ahead of competitors.
Ultimately, the question all organizations will ask themselves in the next year is, ‘How can we avoid redundancies in our business, while making the most of our time? With every checked box is an earnest, but tedious, approach and IT delivery paradigms should be simplified, sleek and uncomplicated. Businesses should build the risk out of their systems, and realize that it’s what’s under the hood that truly impacts demand – it also holds the key to the next generation of innovation and improvements to the bottom line.
