President Obama today owned up to many of the problems with HealthCare.gov , the federal health exchange, admitting that there’s no “sugar coating it.”
During a speech delivered to the nation in the Rose Garden today, the President stressed that the buggy website will be fixed.
On Oct. 1, millions of Americans flooded to the site to shop for cheaper health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. For the past two weeks, the web system costing over $400 million has deeply embarrassed the White House, with millions of people claiming that they couldn’t log in.
The President said that nothing was more “maddening” than these technical issues. However, he stressed that the Administration is recruiting some of the brightest minds in the nation to improve the website.
“Everyone who wants insurance will get insurance. Period,” he said.
This speech follows a blog post released Sunday  from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The health agency admitted that the experience with the federal exchange must have been “frustrating” for Americans.
The agency did not reveal any information about how it plans to fix HealthCare.gov. However, President Obama said today that the top private sector tech companies are lining up to  offer their services .
“We’re well into the tech surge to fix the problem,” he said.
The federal government signed over two dozen contracts with IT players to build HealthCare.gov. In the wake of all the problems, outside experts questioned whether the site was run on modern, cloud-based technology at all.
For Americans that are still experiencing issues with the site, the President suggested a few alternatives: Make a phone call (the call center recently staffed up) to sign up for insurance in less than 45 minutes, or pay a visit to a local care provider.
Insurance doesn’t start until Jan. 1 and Americans won’t need to pay a premium until Dec. 15.
“The product is good … in some cases it has even exceeded expectations,” said the President.
