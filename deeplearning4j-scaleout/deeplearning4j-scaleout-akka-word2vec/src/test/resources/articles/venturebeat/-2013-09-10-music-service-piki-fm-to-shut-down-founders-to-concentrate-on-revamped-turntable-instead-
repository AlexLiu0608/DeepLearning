The team behind Piki.fm , the music recommendation radio service, announced today via e-mail that the service would be shutting down, a move that’s effective as of the end of September.
Piki, which was started by the same people who brought you Turntable.fm , approached music recommendation by creating algorithms based on what your friends are listening to rather than grouping songs together because they sound similar or belong to a particular genre. It was structured like Pandora, rather than an on-demand music service like Spotify. Personally, I loved the service and am sad to see it go.
Instead of closing down the service entirely, the Piki team said it would be refocusing all its efforts around a new version of Turntable.fm that should roll out sometime in October.
Here’s the official email the team just sent out:
We’re really sad to say that on September 23rd we will be shutting down Piki. We are a small team and unfortunately we don’t have the resources to continue developing and maintaining Piki. We sincerely thank you for trying Piki and we hope that you enjoyed it as much as we did.
The team has refocused on a new version of turntable.fm , coming early October. If you’re interested in getting an email when we launch, please enter your email here http://bit.ly/14o3gdJ
We’re not going to leave you empty handed. You can download the list of all of your picks as a CSV file or make it a Spotify playlist here: https://piki.fm/exportmusic
