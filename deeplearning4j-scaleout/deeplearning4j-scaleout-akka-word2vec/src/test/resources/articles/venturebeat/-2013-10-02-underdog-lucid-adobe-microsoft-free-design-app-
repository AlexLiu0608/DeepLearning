Microsoft’s Powerpoint is simple, but its functionality is limited. Adobe’s InDesign is incredibly powerful, but it’s costly and difficult to learn. Lucid Software seeks to carve out a healthy middle ground with its new offering.
Lucid, the company behind cloud-based diagram app Lucidchart, today launched a web-based design and publishing app called Lucidpress .
“Lucidpress is taking on the big guys here,” CEO Karl Sun told VentureBeat. “To date, there really hasn’t been anything that serves the in-between and takes advantage of the possibilities provided by the web.”
Lucidpress is free while it’s in its beta test phase, so interested parties can sign up now and give it a whirl. The company will introduce a “freemium” pricing structure for the public release of the app, which has been in the works for about a year, according to Sun.
Because Lucidpress runs in the cloud, it enables real-time collaboration with colleagues — not unlike Google Drive. Lucidpress can actually grab assets from Google Drive, Flickr, Facebook, Dropbox, and YouTube.
The app’s familiar interface and drag-and-drop functionality promises to keep the learning curve slim, so casual designers shouldn’t have a tough time diving in and creating digital or print projects.
Lucid Software is funded by Google Ventures, 500 Startups, K9 Ventures, and 2M Companies as well as a number of angel investors. The company counts customers from AT&T, Groupon, and Citrix among its more than one million users.
VentureBeat is creating an index of the top 'arms merchants' of the cloud . Take a look at our initial suggestions and  complete the survey  to help us build a definitive index. We’ll publish the official index later this month, and for those who fill out surveys, we’ll send you an expanded report free of charge.
