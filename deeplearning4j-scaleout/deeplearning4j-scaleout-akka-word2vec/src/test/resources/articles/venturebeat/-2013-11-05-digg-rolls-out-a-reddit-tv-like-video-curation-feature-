Digg , the Phoenix of community news sharing services , has launched a new feature today that helps aggregate videos from across the web into a single stream of (theoretically) interesting content.
The new feature, called Digg Video , will pull in all the most popular video content from Facebook and Twitter as well as what’s most popular on Digg itself (meaning, videos with the highest number of Digg votes). Much like the main Digg news site, Digg Video presents you with a top video story followed by a two-column layout of all the hottest clips. Content is actually curated from all the hottest videos by site editors, which makes it nearly impossible to artificially game a video clip to the top.
The new feature is cool, and kind of takes after the third-party video site Reddit.tv , which actually just pulls in all the top video submissions from each individual subreddit (aka ultra specific news category). But Digg Video isn’t designed to be a “lean back” service, at least not at this time. That means you need to select each video that you want to watch, and you don’t have the option to sort through the videos. (By contrast, Reddit.tv allows you to automatically play the next video and sort those videos according to submission time, the number of votes, or hottest.) There are about 36 videos on the page that will get periodically changed throughout the day.
Since relaunching the site back in 2012, Digg said its video tag “has consistently garnered more traffic than any other,” which makes the new video feature somewhat of a no-brainer. Also, video advertising is gaining in popularity among advertisers, as demonstrated by AOL’s recent video ad win thanks to its purchase of Adap.tv.
Digg said it plans to add the new Digg Video features to its iOS and Android mobile apps in the near future.
