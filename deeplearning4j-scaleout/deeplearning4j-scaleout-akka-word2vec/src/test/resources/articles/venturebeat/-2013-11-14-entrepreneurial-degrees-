While the notion of dropping out to start your life’s work is romantic in Silicon Valley, many others are starting to look at “entrepreneurial MBAs.”
We heard about the top 50 colleges in America today, which of course include the tops like Stanford and Harvard, which Mark Zuckerberg famously dropped out of to start Facebook. But institutions offering business degrees are starting to hear that cry for entrepreneurial independence. That’s why they’re skewing toward founder-focused courses, teaching students how to become business owners and not just cogs in the corporate machine.
Since 1975, entrepreneurial courses have increased around 1,800 percent in colleges around the United States, according to the infographic below.
If you’re an undergrad looking for a strong entrepreneurship-based education, Greatbusinessschools.org surprisingly recommends Babson College, University of Houston, and University of Southern California as its top picks. This is based on tuition, the percentage of faculty members who are entrepreneurs, scholarships, percentage of recent grads who started a business, the percentage of those businesses that have survived, and the number of entrepreneurship organizations available on campus.
If you’re looking for an entrepreneurial grad degree, the University of Michigan might be the place to go. Online degrees are also popping up, with Oklahoma State University and the University of Florida leading the pack, according to Greatbusinessschools.org.
