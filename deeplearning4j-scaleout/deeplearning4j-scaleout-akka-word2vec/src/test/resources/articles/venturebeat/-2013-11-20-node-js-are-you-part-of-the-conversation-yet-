The widespread adoption of Node.js in such a short period of time is nothing short of astounding. It is virtually unheard of for the biggest names in the technology world to throw their support behind and put such a heavy reliance on something that has yet to reach version 1.0, but that is exactly what has happened with the adoption of Node.js.
Companies including Microsoft, DirecTV, eBay, Walmart, LinkedIn, Groupon, GoDaddy, PayPal, HBO, Netflix, Yahoo, MasterCard, and Creative Artists Agency are among the hundreds of companies that have adopted Node.js and are publicly discussing the reasons they use Node as well as the benefits resulting from this decision.
Node Summit 2013 is the only conference devoted entirely to the business implications of Node.js and the web development ecosystem being built around it.
At Node Summit, business leaders and technology experts come together to explore how Node.js is enabling the creation of real-time, high-performance, scalable, networked applications. Through content-rich discussions, panels, and featured presentations, speakers will delve into the important role that Node.js plays in the growing web ecosystem. Attendees will learn how Node.js impacts businesses and consumers today and hear visionary ideas for future implementations of the runtime.
“We started working on the first Node Summit event in early 2011 because we thought Node.js was an interesting technology but there were a limited number of people talking about the significant impact it could have,” said Charles Beeler, the producer of the Node Summit Conferences and a General Partner at Icon Venture Partners. “Today, Node.js is established as a key technology that will play a crucial role in the future of connected computing. Node Summit 2013 explores every facet of Node.js’ role in today’s web ecosystem and everyone at the event will play an important role in elevating the Node.js conversation. Anybody interested in the future of web development should be present and join the conversation.”
The two-day conference is Dec. 3-Dec. 4 in San Francisco.  Registration is still open  — and discounted tickets are available to readers using the code [ MPVEN20 ].
The agenda has all the details about sessions that are packed with topics such as real-time web, high-performance computing, scalable applications, mobile application development, big data, and platform-as-a-service.
The Node Summit 2013 hosts the first ever NodeTalks , which are 20 speaker-submitted proposals chosen by a panel of judges representing some of the leaders in the Node.js community. These 30 minute sessions cover topics ranging from high-performance networks to database architectures to APIs. All share one important common theme: Node.js.
The Node Summit 2013 also hosts the second annual NodeJam Startup Competition, during which 24 companies take the stage for fast-paced pitches to the Node Summit audience and a panel of venture capitalists and corporate investors.
