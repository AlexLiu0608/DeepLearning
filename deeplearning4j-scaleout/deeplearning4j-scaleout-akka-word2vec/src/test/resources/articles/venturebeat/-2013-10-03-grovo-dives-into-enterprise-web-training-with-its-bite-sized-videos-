Grovo  has grown up from a tool to help individuals learn more about the web to something that can train entire organizations.
The New York City-based company is today announcing Grovo for Teams , an online training dashboard that makes it easier for organizations to manage online training among its employees.
Grovo offers short and sweet one-minute training videos for a wide variety of web services, which means it’s an ideal way for employees to learn new things like Google Apps, Yammer, and Office 365 without bugging their IT department. The dashboard allows company administrators to assign training sessions (and follow-up quizzes) to specific employees. It also offers reporting tools so administrators can keep track of progress through the lessons.
Jeff Fernandez, Grovo’s cofounder and CEO, tells me the company started down the rabbit hole of enterprise training after getting a call from Chevron around eight months ago. The oil giant wanted a way to easily train all of its employees, so it ended up working together with Grovo to help shape the Teams product for its Public Affairs division. Grovo has also landed enterprise training contracts with Pitney Bowes, Sotheby’s, and other firms, as well as several schools.
Grovo for Teams pricing starts at $199 per seat annually. Packages starting at five  employees cost $83 a month. Grovo currently offers more than 3,500 short training videos covering more than 100 sites and apps.
“Short videos don’t limit our ability to do more complicated coverage,” Fernandez told me. When diving into complex topics, Grovo just makes several minute-long videos. That makes the lessons easier to consume, especially on the company’s recently launched iOS app . Grovo’s website is also accessible from most mobile platforms.
Grovo recently raised a $5.5 million funding round led by Greg Waldorf, the former CEO of eHarmony.
“The cloud is proliferating, it’s having an impact on our personal and professional lives, and as the cloud proliferates, so does Grovo,” Fernandez said.
