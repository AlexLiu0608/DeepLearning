The world really doesn’t need an affordable tablet in ugly shades of orange and yellow — at least the adult world anyways.
Samsung is betting that the market for such a tablet does exist for children, and today announced plans to launch a new Galaxy Tab 3 Kids  device sporting the aforementioned color scheme. It seems like a smart move for the company since the number of children watching video and playing educational games on tablets has continuously risen — as has the number of apprehensive parents who are probably reluctant to hand over their $200 – $500 device to them.
The Kids Tablet itself has a 7-inch screen, 1024×600 screen, 1.2Ghz dual-core processor, 1GB of RAM, and 8GB. It costs $230, which is a bit more than the regular Galaxy Tab 3 of the same size. However, this version allows you to toggle better a kids mode that provides only child-safe settings and an a full version of Android — meaning its built for use by many people. Another key gem that the Galaxy Tab Kids is also a bit studier and can withstand some dropping, banging, and other rough play via a specialized case, which will come in handy for kids who don’t really understand how fragile a tablet can be.
The new tablet is scheduled to hit retail stores Nov. 10, just weeks before the insane holiday shopping season officially kicks off.
