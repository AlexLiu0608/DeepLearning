Google is going to have a new voice.
During Google’s quarterly earnings call Thursday afternoon, CEO Larry Page said he may not participate in the company’s future financial reporting calls.
It’s somewhat unusual for major tech CEOs to skip their company’s quarterly earnings calls, but not without precedent — Steve Jobs often skipped Apple calls as he battled health issues.
Page didn’t provide a specific reason he won’t be joining future calls, but it’s most likely a result of his vocal cord issues. Page has dealt with throat problems for more than a decade, as he explained in a Google+ post this May, but it only started affecting his ability to speak at length last year.
“Fast forward to last summer, when the same pattern repeated itself — a cold followed by a hoarse voice,” he wrote. “Once again things didn’t fully improve, so I went in for a check-up and was told that my second vocal cord now had limited movement as well.”
Today’s announcement is not necessarily an indication that Page’s condition is worsening; perhaps he decided he just doesn’t want to be the voice of Google.
