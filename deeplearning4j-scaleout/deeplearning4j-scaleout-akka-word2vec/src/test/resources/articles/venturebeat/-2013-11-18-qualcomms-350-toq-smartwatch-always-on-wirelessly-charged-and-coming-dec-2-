Qualcomm’s always-on Toq smartwatch is only two weeks from hitting your wrist.
Qualcomm announced today that the $350 device will go on sale December 2, which, not coincidentally, happens to be Cyber Monday.
The smartwatch,  unveiled back in September , isn’t really supposed to be a mass-market device. Instead, it’s a limited edition proof-of-concept that’s meant to entice third-party companies into using some of the Toq’s tech in their own devices.
Some of that tech is pretty interesting. For one, the Toq comes with a Qualcomm’s Mirasol display, which uses ambient light to offer clear viewing experiences even in direct sunlight. More, the display consumes little power and is always-on, both of which are key features for watches.
The Toq is far from small.
Another notable inclusion here is WiPower, Qualcomm’s wireless charging technology. The tech, which is already approved for third-party devices, represents exactly the kind of forward thinking you’d hope more smartwatch makers would adopt.
It’s too early to say whether the Toq will get the same cold reception as the Galaxy Gear, but at this point it’s certainly more interesting.
