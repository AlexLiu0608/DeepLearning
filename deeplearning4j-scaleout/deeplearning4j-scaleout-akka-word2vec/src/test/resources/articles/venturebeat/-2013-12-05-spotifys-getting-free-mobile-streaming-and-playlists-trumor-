The web is buzzing this evening with a rumor/trumor that Spotify’s getting ready to unveil something big: free streaming music for mobile devices. This would include the ability to play playlists.
These details come via anonymous sources for ABC News and the Wall Street Journal. Spotify has declined to comment.
Currently, Spotify has mobile apps that are free to download; however, most streaming capabilities are only available for paid customers. Free customers have to make do with tracks already stored on their phones or Pandora-like streaming of Spotify-selected genre stations. Boo.
Premium accounts currently cost $10 per month. “Freemium” desktop functionality allows users to stream music but intersperses it with advertising. The aforementioned mystery sources said the free mobile streaming service would also feature ads.
Just days ago, the startup launched new analytics tools for musicians, including a new dashboard for artists that shows comprehensive listening activity thanks to a partnership with Next Big Sound as well as data about concerts and merchandise sales via Topspin.
All this comes on the heels of a huge financial announcement: a $250 million fundraise and $4 billion valuation.
Spotify, which originated in Stockholm, Sweden, was founded in 2006 and has raised $538 million in venture funding to date.
