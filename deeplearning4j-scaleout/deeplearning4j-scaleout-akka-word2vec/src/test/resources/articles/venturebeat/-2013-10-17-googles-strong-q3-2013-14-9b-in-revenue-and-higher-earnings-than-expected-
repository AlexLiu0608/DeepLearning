Consolidate revenues
Last quarter Google earned $14 billion, with almost all of it — $13.1 billion — coming from ad revenue. That was 19 percent growth, year-over-year, and added $4 billion in profit to Google’s overflowing coffers. This quarter’s growth was only 12 percent, but still strong.
Some highlights from this quarter:
paid clicks increased approximately 26 percent
cost-per-click dipped approximately 8 percent
traffic acquisition costs jumped $200 million, but dipped as a percentage of income
Motorola contributed  $1.18 billion, or eight percent of Google’s revenue
International income continued its ongoing growth for Google, with its international share of revenue topping 56 percent, up from 55 percent last quarter, and also up from 53 percent in the year-ago equivalent quarter.
The company says it will continue to invest in three major areas: ads (search and display advertising), high-growth businesses (YouTube, Android, and Chrome), and new businesses (social, commerce, and enterprise).
