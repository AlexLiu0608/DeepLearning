Uber has already tried its hand at delivering condoms , so why not cats, too?
In honor of National Cat Day (which exists, apparently),  Uber is teaming up with local animal shelters  to deliver cats straight to your home or office.
The service, which will run just for today, costs $20 and comes with 15 minutes of cat time, along with cupcakes and a “Uberiffic Cat Pack.” The company says that all the cash from the sessions will go directly to your city’s local shelter. You’ll even have a chance to adopt any of the cats you fall in love with.
Unfortunately for most of you out there, the service will only be available in New York, San Francisco, and Seattle, which is a small subset of the 30-plus cities where Uber operates here in the U.S. Uber also warns that the supply of cats is finite, and it may be tough to get your hands on one initially.
While Uber’s move is a bit bizarre, it fits somewhat well with some of the company’s recent diversions, which include free rides to Boston school kids , Hamptons helicopters, and the aforementioned condom delivery service.
No, we don’t really get it either.
