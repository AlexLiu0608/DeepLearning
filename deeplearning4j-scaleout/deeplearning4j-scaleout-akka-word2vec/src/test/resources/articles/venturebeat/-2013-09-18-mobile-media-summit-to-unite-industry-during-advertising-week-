After hearing that every coming year will be the year for mobile, mobile is finally here, and it’s bigger than ever. According to the latest numbers from eMarketer, the overall mobile ad market is expected to grow 89 percent to $16.65 billion in 2013, and global smartphone adoption has already tipped over 50 percent.
The Mobile Media Summit and Upfront , the largest mobile events series in North America, was formed in 2008 to recognize the importance of this growing industry and provide a forum for brand, agency, and mobile leaders to come together and discuss the newest mobile technology and media.
On Sept. 23, the first day of Advertising Week in New York, the Mobile Media Summit will stage its final and biggest conference of 2013 at the famed New World Stages. Beginning with a keynote speech by Anita Stewart, the senior VP global strategic partnerships and development at Sesame Workshop, the day-long program will focus on how marketers and agencies are using mobile in their 2013 holiday marketing strategies as well as how they’re using it to grow distribution and revenue.
The Mobile Media Summit also introduces the inaugural Mobile Mafia Awards, honoring the year’s best work in categories ranging from best mobile platform to most innovative agency in mobile. A premier panel of creative and digital leaders will judge submissions, including Activision VP of global brand marketing Jonathan Anastas, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide chief digital officer Brandon Berger, McGarryBowen chief digital creative officer Steve Hicks, DDB Worldwide chief creative officer Amir Kassaei, and JTW New York ECD Eric Weisberg. The winners will be honored at a Mobile Mafia dinner following the Summit.
“I am honored to have so many leaders from advertising, digital, media and mobile continue to support us in moving the industry forward. This year’s event has a record number of brands coming, which clearly shows how brands are aggressively investing in mobile media, advertising and marketing,” said Mobile Media Summit founder and CEO Paran Johar.
