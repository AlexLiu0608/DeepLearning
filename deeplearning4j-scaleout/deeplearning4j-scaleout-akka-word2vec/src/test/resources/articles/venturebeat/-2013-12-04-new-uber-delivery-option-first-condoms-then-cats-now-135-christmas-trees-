OK, so first it was condoms . Then it was same-day cat delivery service . And now, on-demand car service Uber is offering Christmas tree deliveries.
You better have a pretty flush wallet, though.
Uber announced on its blog today that it is initiating Christmas tree delivery service in 10 cities in partnership with Home Depot, including New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. I just spent $40 on a 7-foot Noble Fir, but Uber will charge $135 for the same tree.
Ouch!
There is a bit more too it, of course. Not only do you get the tree — and the door-to-door delivery — you also get a tree stand and an unspecified “Uber gift.” That’s probably a discount or voucher for Uber service. And there’s no need for cash, Uber will take payment via PayPal, Google Wallet, or credit card ( score one for digital wallets !).
To get your ho-ho-ho via Uber, download the app and request the tree between 11AM and 8PM on Thursday this week. Other cities that are participating are Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Philadelphia, San Diego, and Washington DC.
But you’d better do it early.
Uber says availability will be “very limited.”
