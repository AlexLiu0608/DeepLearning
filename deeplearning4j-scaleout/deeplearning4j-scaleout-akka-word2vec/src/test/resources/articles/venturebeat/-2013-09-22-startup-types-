Startups have to have a strong sense of identity when they pitch venture capitalists who have seen it all before — twice.
The infographic below from Investorpitches.com may be able to help you discover just what kind of startup you are and how that startup’s story can hook an investor. For example, “The Emancipator” is a startup that wants to help make life that much easier for its customers. Outbox is an example of this, trying to liberate people from the annoying task of going through (and often throwing out) your mail.
Another example is the startup that comes from an awesome, often formerly successful founder. This startup has one guy at the helm who has been there before, knows how to make it work, and has the track record to prove it.
So, check out the infographic below and tell us in the comments what kind of startup are you and how will you let that inform the story you tell?
