Shopping is an important part of the Christmas season — and it’s becoming more and more important each year. One reason for the rising popularity in holiday shopping is the increasing numbers of cheap holiday deals and special offers. Many online sellers hold holiday special offers and deals. As a leading and reliable multimedia software provider, Leawo offers super-low prices on its video converter and DVD ripper suite with an 80 percent off deal as part of its  2013 Christmas Promotion .
The 80 percent off deal for this video converter and DVD ripper suite is from Dec. 22 to Dec. 26. Leawo is offering its  Video Converter Ultimate at only $9.95 per license for one year’s use. Here is how it works: You have an HD movie or a DVD, but you have no way to play your it on mobile devices such as the iPad, Surface, Galaxy Note III, use professional video editing tools, or upload to YouTube and blog for sharing. It’s also a great tool for burning or converting video you’ve shot of your family’s holiday antics to DVDs. The Leawo Video Converter Ultimate helps you easily solve format incompatibility issues between your HD movies/DVDs and media players/devices.
The Leawo Video Converter Ultimate is a video converter and DVD ripper package with a variety of functions:
Video Converter: This media converter suite acts as a HD video converter that can easily convert video/audio between various formats for multiple devices and extract audio from video so that you can save it in various formats. It can process both standard video and up to 1080p HD videos no loss in quality.
DVD Ripper : The suite also is a professional DVD converter. Video Converter Ultimate can help decrypt, rip, and convert DVDs to SD/HD videos or extract audio from DVD movies so that you can save in multiple formats. It can convert CSS-DVDs and common discs as well.
DVD Burner: This video converter and DVD ripper suite converts video to DVDs to help you easily convert and burn videos in multiple formats from many sources (including ISO image files). As a DVD burner, it offers multiple preset disc menu and template models for video-to-DVD burning. It even provides a disc menu designer so you can design your own menus and templates.
YouTube video downloader: Far more than a video converter, DVD ripper, and DVD burner combo, Leawo Video Converter Ultimate downloads videos from YouTube, Facebook, Veoh, VEVO, Yahoo, and more at no additional charge. It can download and convert these online videos to save in multiple formats for various uses.
Video editor: You can edit videos by trimming video length, cropping video size, adjusting video brightness, contrast, saturation, etc., and applying images or text watermarks.
2D-to-3D converter: For 3D movie fans, this video converter toolbox enables you to create 3D movies out of 2D video/DVD sources in six different 3D effects: Red/Cyan, Red/Green, Red/Blue, Blue/Yellow, Interleaved, and Side-by-Side. The 3D depth is also adjustable to make the final 3D movie more vivid.
Leawo Video Converter Ultimate converts video/DVD or burns DVD from video in 180-plus formats like MP4, AVI, FLV, F4V, MKV, WMV, 3GP, MPEG, VOB, TS, M2TS, etc., for most devices — iPad, iPhone, iPod, Surface, Android, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, Windows Media Player, and more.
