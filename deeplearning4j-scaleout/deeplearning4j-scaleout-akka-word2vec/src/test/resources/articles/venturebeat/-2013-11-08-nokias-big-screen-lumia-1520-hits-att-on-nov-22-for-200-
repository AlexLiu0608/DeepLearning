You’ll be able to get your hands on the first 6-inch Windows Phone, Nokia’s Lumia 1520, before Thanksgiving.
Nokia and AT&T announced today that the phone should arrive on AT&T’s network on Nov. 22 for $200 on-contract. Preorders start today.
The Lumia 1520 serves as Nokia’s big-screen flagship, with a 6-inch screen, 1080p resolution display, quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor running at 2.2GHz, and 20 megapixel Pureview camera (the same shooter as the Lumia 1020′s fantastic camera). It’s our first glimpse at what such a large-screen phone (a category known as “phablets”) will mean for Windows Phone. With the additional screen space, you’ll be able to cram even more live tile icons onto your home screen.
Both Microsoft and AT&T are trying to sweeten the pot: If you order through Microsoft’s online store, you’ll get $70 of app store credit, a copy of Halo: Spartan Assault, and a flip cover, while AT&T’s store will give you $20 of credit, 50 GB of cloud storage, and a copy of the same game.
