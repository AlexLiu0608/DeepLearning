Mobile player-acquisition platform PlayHaven is thriving, according to company’s latest boasts.
Today, PlayHaven revealed that it is now working with 10,000 developers on more than 20,000 games. That’s quadruple the number of games PlayHaven was serving in 2012. The company’s network now also encompasses 800 million unique gamers. That’s up 175 percent over 2012 and up 42 percent from the previous quarter.
PlayHaven’s monthly active users (MAUs) are up 150 percent year-over-year to 176 million .
PlayHaven’s platform, which also goes by the name PlayHaven, offers developers tools to acquire and retain players. It also helps game creators figure out how to maximize revenues for their titles. Its most recent product is PlayHaven Push Notifications , which enables developers to customize popup alerts to their gamers to inform them about in-game deals and offers.
“PlayHaven is building a comprehensive set of intelligent tools that developers can use to manage a successful business,” PlayHaven chief executive Andy Yang said in a statement. “We do this by getting in the trenches with developers every day — learning what happens in their games, providing helpful insights, and crafting creative solutions that help them solve their problems.”
Some developers and publishers that use PlayHaven include Cartoon Network, Glu Mobile, and Sega. Big publishers like that are drawn to it because it provides control over nearly the entire business aspect of making mobile games.
“PlayHaven’s platform plays a key role in allowing Glu to effectively communicate with our players,” Glu Mobile president of publishing Chris Akhavan said. “In particular, we get a lot of value from PlayHaven’s segmentation capabilities and are glad they are extending their offerings into push notifications.”
Mobile gaming’s popularity and financial viability have never looked stronger. PlayHaven’s huge numbers follow news that Clash of Clans developer SuperCell is worth $3 billion and Chinese mobile-gaming company Chukong has raised $80 million in its four funding rounds.
It’s a party for mobile gaming. A global-business party, and business is booming.
