Dramatic Workflow Improvements Offered by Nimble Contacts Widget Now       Available in Leading Business Productivity Apps, including Gmail,       Outlook and HootSuite
SANTA MONICA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–November 5, 2013–
Today, Nimble , the pioneer in       social relationship management software, announced the newest release of       its award-winning platform with significant updates across the board.       These new features enable true social selling at an advanced level for       users of Nimble, everywhere they work. Highlights include:
Nimble Contacts Widgets for Google Gmail, Microsoft Outlook and         Hootsuite
Social Connection Status for Individuals and Teams
Intelligent Contact Analyzer to help Identify and Connect with         Important Contacts
Stay-in-Touch Reminder System with Important People Workflow

Nimble Everywhere
Today, people spend over 28       percent of the workweek , over 13 hours, in their inbox — sending,       receiving, and sorting emails. Nimble is now making this time more       streamlined, intelligent, and productive.
“We’ve created Nimble Contact Widgets that fit into the leading       applications each business person lives in all day, every day,” said       Nimble CEO Jon Ferrara. “By dropping the Nimble Contacts Widget into       your workflow, now available in Gmail (as well as Outlook), you’ll never       go wanting for a complete profile of a contact ever again. The insights,       histories, efficiencies and productivity gleaned from Nimble social       profiling is second to none.”
Nimble offers a powerful, productive window into all your contacts. By       using Nimble you gain actionable insights by having every detail of the       contact record at your fingertips — all within a leading application       like Gmail.
See, Don’t Search
Using Nimble improves every sales, business development or marketing       approach. The new Nimble Contact record consolidates on a single view       all the actionable, socially relevant information about a person you       need for context, putting an end to wasted time searching for       information online. With Nimble, users have access to rich social       portraits, complete communications history and advanced profiling       methods at their fingertips.
Nimble recommends the people who matter most to you at any given time,       based on profiling factors such as: Shared Topics, Matched Keywords and       Recency or Frequency of contact. From there, Nimble shows how you are       connected. Users who work on teams can also quickly see (from a sidebar       display) how they or other team members are connected to a given contact.
Beyond deep contact-specific information, Nimble enables effective       interaction and follow-up through its advanced contact management       features.
Contact Management Redefined
The new version of Nimble adds a set of features to establish an       intuitive workflow for nurturing and engagement:
Mark-as-Important Stars
Stay-in-Touch Reminders
Assign Activities, Add Notes, and Attach to Deals right from the         Contact Widget or Record
Nimble’s smart, automated follow-up prompts are generated thanks to       Nimble monitoring your communications across networks, only informing       you when important people fall out of touch, eliminating needless       self-scheduling of reminders.
New time-saving capabilities include the ability to take action easily       in one place, by simply beginning to type to Add a Task or Log a Note.
“It was surprisingly easy to re-invent my whole contact workflow by       simply telling Nimble which contacts I wanted to stay in touch with and       how often,” said Celina Guerrero, President of Social to Sales       (@socialtosales). “I can see whether or not I’m connected to an       individual, regardless of social network. I have a complete profile in       front of me that gives me context and topics of interest– which enables       me to get to a greater intimacy and build better relationships with an       entirely new level of speed and efficiency.”
The Nimble platform also now offers more robust searching and sorting       capabilities such as the Advanced Search drop-down menu.
