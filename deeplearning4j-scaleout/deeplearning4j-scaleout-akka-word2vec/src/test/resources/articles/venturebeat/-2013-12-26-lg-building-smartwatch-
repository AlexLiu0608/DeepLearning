LG Electronics is reportedly working on some new wearable offerings, with a rumored G-Arch smartwatch and G-Health fitness wristband in the works. The new gadgets would sync with the upcoming LG G3 smartphone and could be unveiled at the Mobile World Congress conference in February 2014.
Industry sources also mentioned that LG was developing fingerprint recognition technology on the G3, which would allow users to interact with their phone with a swipe — the iPhone 5s’ Touch ID sensor relies on capacitive touch to scan fingers that rest on the home button. The phone will also pack a quad HD display and 2.2 GHz 8-core processor, reports the Korea Herald . We mustn’t put too much stock in rumors, but LG has confirmed to Engadget that it is working on a wearable product .
The idea also makes quite a bit of sense. Wearable gear is (for better or worse) going to to be making the rounds quite a bit in the next year and beyond as device manufacturers scramble to catch up to smaller players like Pebble .
We weren’t exactly smitten with Samsung’s Galaxy Gear smartwatch , which proved bulky and largely superfluous. And the less said about its tone-deaf advertising campaign , the better. But companies like LG would be foolish if they didn’t try to get a piece of this pie.
