Dell is introducing a 15.6-inch laptop that has an absurdly high resolution. The new Dell XPS 15 laptop has a 15.6-inch display that has a resolution of 3,200 x 1,800.

That means it has more than five times the number of pixels compared to a normal high-definition display. The Quad HD+ display has 5.7 million pixels. The XPS 15 is the first laptop to use an oxide TFT display technology.
The screen displays sharper detail for movies, particularly those in the fledgling 4K format, and it means that web text will be sharper. Playing a game is probably the most taxing thing you can do with the machine.
Youâ€™ll be able to see hundreds more cells simultaneously in an Excel spreadsheet. That may sound cool, but there is very little content that can take advantage of the full capabilities of the touchscreen.
The XPS 15 is 18 millimeters thick and has a 14-hour battery life. It has a 160-degree viewing angle.
It has a machined aluminum case and a carbon fiber composite base that makes it lighter. The touchscreen is made of Corning Gorilla Glass NBT, which has 10 times better scratch resistance than soda lime glass. It has a new Intel Haswell processor up to a quad-core Core i7 and an Nvidia GeForce GT 750M 2GB graphics chip. It has 16 gigabytes of main memory and weighs 4.4 pounds.
The machine is one of three new XPS models and a bunch of tablets that Dell is introducing today. The XPS 15 starts at $1,500 and will be available in the U.S. on Oct. 18.
