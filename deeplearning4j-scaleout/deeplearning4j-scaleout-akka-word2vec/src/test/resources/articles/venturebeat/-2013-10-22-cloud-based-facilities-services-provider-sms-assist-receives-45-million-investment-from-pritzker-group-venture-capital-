CHICAGO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 22, 2013–
Pritzker       Group Venture Capital , formerly New World Ventures, today announced       it invested $45 million in Chicago-based SMS       Assist , the advanced mobile and cloud-based facilities maintenance       technology company. This brings the Pritzkers’ total investment to $62       million.
“SMS Assist has disruptive technology that is significantly reducing       facilities maintenance expenses for some of the nation’s largest       companies. Validating the company’s growth trajectory is a series of       high-value contracts, including one of the largest in retail facilities       maintenance history. We are helping to build a great company that is       fundamentally changing its industry,” said J.B. Pritzker, Pritzker       Group’s managing partner.
SMS Assist offers advanced mobile and cloud-based technology capable of       managing millions of daily facilities maintenance service orders. Its       28,000 affiliated providers currently service more than 50,000 U.S.       locations for a client base primarily comprised of Fortune 500       companies. SMS’s proprietary technology platform turns cost centers into       expense reduction centers by identifying innovative ways to reduce       expenses and gain operational efficiencies while improving service       quality. Customers also benefit from real-time visibility into work       orders and spend by store, service type and geography, data that is       unique to SMS Assist.
SMS       Assist recently announced it won a major multi-year contract       expansion with a major retailer, consolidating services at nearly 8,000       U.S. locations.
