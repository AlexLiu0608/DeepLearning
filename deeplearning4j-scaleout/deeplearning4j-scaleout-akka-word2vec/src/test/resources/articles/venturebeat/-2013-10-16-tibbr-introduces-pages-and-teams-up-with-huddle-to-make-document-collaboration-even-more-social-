Tibbr’s 6.5 million paid users will see some changes when they log into the enterprise social network today.
At Tibco’s TUCON user conference Wednesday, the company introduced a Tibbr feature called Pages, which allows users to find, curate, and publish pages full of content. You can drag-and-drop different content items into one place, then share it with coworkers.
With Pages, “You can construct, distribute, and have conversations around a living mosaic of information streams and provide a holistic view of a particular subject,” said Ram Menon, president of social computing at Tibco Software.

Tibco also announced a partnership with cloud collaboration company Huddle. Beginning Wednesday, you can browse Huddle workspaces, search for specific files, upload new content, and attach Huddle files to social updates without leaving Tibbr — and vice versa from within Huddle.
“The integration supercharges users’ productivity,” Huddle CEO Alastair Mitchell told VentureBeat. “Content collaboration and enterprise social networking are combined in one central environment so people don’t have to skip between multiple apps to get their jobs done.”
Tibbr also features integrations with Box, Dropbox, and Google Drive, but Mitchell was quick to distinguish Huddle from competing services. Huddle was built from the ground up for enterprise and government organizations rather than starting out as a consumer service that pivoted to cater to the enterprise (a prime example being Dropbox for Business). And the company is more than a storage solution, he stressed, with collaboration tools that let users manage file versions, share feedback, comment, and view audit trails.
Tibbr faces some stiff competition from Microsoft’s Yammer, Salesforces’ Chatter, and Jive, among other enterprise social networks. But partnerships with social tools like Huddle set it apart, Tibco’s social computing president Ram Menon told VentureBeat.
“Tibbr is not a standalone tool,” said Menon. “It provides a breadth of adjacent, bundled social capabilities via integrations with tools you use on a daily basis that other systems don’t [offer].”
Menon also noted that Tibbr is available in the cloud and on-premise, so customers don’t have to settle for one or the other.
Integrating the two technologies was relatively easy thanks to their “great APIs,” said Mitchell. The partnership took a few months to hammer out and implement and doesn’t affect the price of either service.
Right now, there’s only one joint Huddle-Tibbr customer: a large, undisclosed U.S. government agency with “tens of thousands” of shared users. A Huddle representative declined to provide any additional details.
