The year is coming to a close, which means it’s time to look back and determine some winners. In 2013, it’s clear that two games — Minecraft and Candy Crush Saga — were a pair of champions on the iOS platform .
This reaffirms that while many use their smartphones and tablets for a variety of purposes, gaming is the No. 1 activity in the mobile world.
Apple revealed a few year-end charts for its iOS App Store, and Minecraft was the best-seller on both iPad and iPhone. For free-to-play games, Candy Crush Saga was the No. 1 download for iPhone and iPad.
The top-grossing apps for 2013 are Candy Crush Saga and Clash of Clans, reports Distimo.
Minecraft: Pocket Edition debuted on iOS in November 2011. Despite its age, the block-building game that puts players into an open world has continued to bring in new fans at a huge rate in 2013. Developer Mojang has sold more than 33 million copies of Minecraft across all platforms, with a huge chunk of that coming from mobile.
Here are the rest of the paid charts for iPhone and iPad:
