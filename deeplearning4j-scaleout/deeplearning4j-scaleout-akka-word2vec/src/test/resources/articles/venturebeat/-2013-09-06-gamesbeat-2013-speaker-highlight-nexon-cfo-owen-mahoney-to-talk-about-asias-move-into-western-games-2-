Owen Mahoney, the chief financial officer at Nexon, will speak in a fireside chat at GamesBeat 2013 on Asia’s growing influence on the U.S. games industry. As the game market undergoes massive shifts to new platforms, it’s heading in the direction of online games and free-to-play business models that Asian game companies such as Nexon pioneered.
Investors and consumers have rewarded a number of the Asian companies with sizable market values and lots of cash. And these publishers and developers are using that clout to move into Western game markets. Nexon has grown into a quiet giant, with more than $1.3 billion in revenues and operating margins over 40 percent in 2012. You can bet that it will become better known in the U.S. Mahoney will discuss the new realities of the U.S. gaming industry, strategies to succeed in the West, and how Nexon plans to disrupt the console status quo.

Our theme for the conference is the “Battle Royal,” where all game companies compete across platforms, territories, digital and physical markets, and categories of games.
We’ve entered an era where many and varied companies are competing for gamers’ time in the same space. Apple and Google want to get in the living room and are waging war against Nintendo and Sony. Microsoft already has an edge in living room entertainment with its Xbox Live service, but it wants a piece of mobile as well. It’s a confusing time for game makers. Where should they take their games? What platforms will provide the best gaming experiences? Who will make them the most money?

We’ll roll out a steady drumbeat of speakers as we get closer to GamesBeat 2013′s October date. We expect to have more than 80 of the gaming industry’s best lined up from our fifth annual event.
Each year, GamesBeat follows a big trend. In 2009, we focused on how “All The World’s a Game,” with the explosion of games on the global stage. In 2010, GamesBeat@GDC focused on “Disruption 2.0.” In 2011, our theme was “Mobile Games Level Up,” focusing on the busy intersection of games and mobile technology. In 2012, we  focused on “The Crossover Era ,” defined by the time when so many big game companies and startups were transforming themselves by expanding from one market to the next.
As companies adapt to change, we’re witnessing disruption, adaptation, consolidation, innovation, and the arrival of big money. We’re talking billions of dollars that are at stake. We’re expecting 400 notables from throughout the game industry — social, mobile, online, and console. Please join us.
