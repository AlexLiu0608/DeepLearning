IBM took a look at shopping trends this Christmas and found what should already be clear: For retailers, iOS is where the money is.
According to IBM , iOS folk on average spent twice as much on Christmas Day as their Android counterparts – $93.94 per order versus $48.10. More, iOS also drove 23 percent of total online sales, versus Android’s 4.6 percent.
The numbers point to a particularly strong year for Christmas Day sales, which IBM says were up 16.5 percent compared to last year. That increase also comes with a big increase in overall mobile shopping, which commanded 29 percent of all online sales on Wednesday.
IBM’s numbers come from its Digital Analytics Benchmark, which tracks transactions from 800 retail sites in real time.
Its latest findings are very much in line with what it saw on Cyber Monday this year, where mobile traffic climbed by 45 percent to account for 31.7 percent of online sales .
Here’s what that looks like in chart form.
