HootSuite announced this morning that is has partnered with Brandwatch, one of the leading social media monitoring and analytics platforms, to bring Brandwatch’s extensive “social business intelligence capabilities” to its users.
And, that it now has over 1,000 enterprise customers, 150 percent higher revenue than last year, and almost eight million users.
Essentially, HootSuite is bringing its engagement and publishing capabilities to the partnership, and Brandwatch is bringing its listening and analytics solutions. It’s not exactly that simple, as HootSuite also has some listening and analytics capability, but Brandwatch gathers data from over 70 million sources globally, helping clients such as Pepsi and Kellogs — and agencies like DDB and Waggener Edstrom — understand what people are saying about their brands and products.

In combination, theoretically, you’ve got the perfect suite: understanding and engagement.
“Our partnership with Brandwatch ensures that users are equipped with a comprehensive set of social media engagement tools that will allow them to, in real-time, stay tuned in to online data that is most crucial and relevant to their needs,” HootSuite CEO Ryan Holmes said in a statement. “I’m thrilled for this Brandwatch integration and what it means for enterprise sales and customer support.”
That’s critical, of course. While HootSuite has free options for limited use, the company has pushed extensively into the enterprise over the past few years via aggressive sales and major integrations with customer support, CRM, helpdesk, and many other software suites via HootSuite apps. (The company also announced today that its users have installed over one million apps over the past two years — apps that integrate HootSuite’s social tools with enterprise-friendly software such as Zendesk, Mailchimp, and more.)
“The integration creates a platform that helps enterprises quickly, easily, and efficiently scale for social business,” Brandwatch CEO and founder Giles Palmer said. “This partnership provides the enterprise with the power to act on and respond to conversations in a smarter fashion, and by separating the signals from the noise, enables our customers to respond to threats and opportunities in the short timelines that social media demands.”
With the new integrated set of tools, HootSuite customers will be able to monitor and engage customers socially, perform complex searches right inside the HootSuite dashboard, analyze and measure sentiment on key initiatives, and do it all from one centralized interface.
Interested HootSuite customers can learn more about the integration and how to use the new features in a webinar on November 7 .
