Apple has reportedly purchased Cue , an app that helps you keep on task, for around $30 to $40 million, according to TechCrunch . The app has since been shuttered.
Cue helped people be as productive as possible throughout the day by watching all the apps and accounts a person uses. It would then deliver relevant information at the right times throughout the day in order to help you stay on top of things. It recently put up a message stating that it would be shutting down despite how it has grown “over the last few years.” It explained that Premium users could request a refund and that it would permanently delete all of its data.
The company was originally called Greplin and was founded in 2010. It later became a Y Combinator startup.
Neither Cue nor Apple confirmed the acquisition, and both Apple Insider and TechCrunch are going off of anonymous tips. The consensus is that the purchase price was somewhere around $35 million, though we haven’t been able to independently confirm this.
The company as a whole will not be completely shut down, however, according to TechCrunch’s sources.
Previous investors include Sequoia Capital, SV Angel, Lerer Ventures, and Index Ventures. The company was based in San Francisco, Calif.
