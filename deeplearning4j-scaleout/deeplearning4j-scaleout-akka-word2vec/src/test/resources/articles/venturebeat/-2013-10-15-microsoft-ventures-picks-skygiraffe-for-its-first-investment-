Many enterprise companies face a problem: They want their employees to work on-the-go, but they don’t have the resources or expertise to create their own mobile apps. The Microsoft-backed SkyGiraffe thinks it has a viable solution to this quandary.
The newly formed Microsoft Ventures has made its first investment in a software company called SkyGiraffe , which helps enterprises deploy mobile apps without writing a line of code.
The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it appears to be more about strategy than cold, hard cash.
“SkyGiraffe has an extremely productive impact on how enterprises operate in the mobile world, while improving employee efficiency and lowering overall IT costs,” said Rahul Sood, the general manager of Microsoft Ventures. “They are a great example of talented founders that have utilized Microsoft’s programs for startups to increase their opportunity to succeed in the market.”
SkyGiraffe operates a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that enables code-free iOS and Android app creation. The apps are “enterprise-grade,” the company promises, enabling secure access to live data like sales and financial information. The platform is currently in private beta.
SkyGiraffe began its relationship with Microsoft through the tech giant’s BizSpark program, which provides free software and support to startups, and was later accepted into Microsoft’s Ventures Accelerator in Israel.
Tel Aviv-based SkyGiraffe previously raised a seed round from 500 Startups and angel investors. The company was founded in February 2012.
