MorphLabs has announced it’s raised $10 million in its fourth round of funding — a relatively small amount given the late stage.
MorphLabs makes OpenStack-integrated products for big-time players in the enterprise, including service providers. The company’s mCloud offering uses OpenStack, a cloud-based operating system, to bring software/hardware open and private cloud technologies to its customers.

The Series D was led by Tallwood Management and Entropy Research Lab with participation from existing investor G2iG. This round brings the company’s funding to date to $22.5 million.
The funding will be used to expand MorphLabs’ business in Asia.
“As an open source technology, OpenStack represents a paradigm shift for enterprises and service providers,” said MorphLabs co-founder and general manager of Asia operations Satoshi Konno in a statement on the news.
“Our OpenStack training for the Asian market will provide ideal support for our users and simplify the deployment of OpenStack clouds throughout the region.”
The training programs will add to MorphLabs’ Asian operations. These training sessions will take place this fall and will be held in Manila, capital of the Philippines; Cebu, the oldest city in the Philippines; Jakarta, capital of Indonesia; Cebu, a province in the Philippines; Singapore; and Hong Kong.
The latter city represents entirely new territory for MorphLabs. The Los Angeles-based startup was founded in 2007 and currently does business in the Philippines, Japan, and Singapore.
