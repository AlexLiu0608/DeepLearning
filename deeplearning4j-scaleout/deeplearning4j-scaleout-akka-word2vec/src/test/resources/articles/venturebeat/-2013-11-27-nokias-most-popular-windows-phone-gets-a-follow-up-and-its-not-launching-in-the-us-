Nokia’s latest budget-focused Lumia is skipping the US — at least for now.
The Lumia 525, which Nokia quietly announced today , is the follow-up to the low-end Lumia 520 , which has become Nokia’s most popular Windows Phone.
Like its predecessor, the Lumia 525 is meant to be affordable for consumers in emerging markets, and its hardware reflects that. The device features a 4-inch display (with a 800 x 480 resolution), 8GB storage, and 1 GB RAM (which, notably, is double that of the Lumia 520). Oh, and it doesn’t come with a 4G radio.
In other words, this isn’t a device meant to blow anyone away. Nokia is aiming the Lumia 525 at markets in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific, not the US and UK, which the company says the device is skipping over right now. On the price front, the Lumia 525 should run for roughly $180-$200 off-contract.
There is, however, a big problem for the Lumia 525, and it comes in the form of the Moto G, which Motorola is aiming at roughly the same markets : The Moto G (which will also run for $180-$200) seems like better deal than the Lumia 525.
