Tech companies are better than other industries at creating company culture, at least according to Glassdoor .
Glassdoor released the findings of its “50 best places to work in 2014″ survey, and 22 of them are tech companies (ranking below).
Twitter ranks as the number one tech company to work for, and this is the first time Twitter made the list. It came in second overall after consulting firm Bain.
LinkedIn followed Twitter on both lists, coming in second in tech and third overall.
Interestingly, Facebook fell in the rankings. The social network was voted the #1 tech company to work for over the past three years, but it’s now fallen to third place in tech and fifth overall. This is the first time Facebook is out of the top three overall in four years.
Google came in sixth amongst the tech companies and eighth overall. Google has consistently been on the list for the past six years, along with Apple and Qualcomm.
Also in the top 10 for tech are Guidewire, Interactive Intelligence, Orbitz, Riverbed, and Intuit. Salesforce just barely made the list, coming in 22nd for tech and 50th overall.
Glassdoor is a site that lets people share information about their employer. Employees provide anonymous data and reviews about salaries, company culture, interview questions, leadership, and more. Glassdoor turns this data into useful reports and helps job seekers determine if a company is a good fit for them.
Glassdoor now has more than 22 million members and custom data on more than 300,000 companies. Just last week, it raised $50 million to accelerate its global expansion. 
More than half a million company reviews were submitted anonymously to Glassdoor by employees over the past 12 months. The surveys ask employees to provide input on how satisfied they are with their company; workplace attributes such as career opportunities, compensation, benefits, culture and values; work-life balance; how they feel senior management is doing; whether they would recommend their employer to a friend; what their opinion is of the company’s outlook, and more.
Glassdoor analyzed all this data to create a ranking of which companies fared the best. This is of particular concern to the tech industry where hiring competition is fierce and companies consistently try to out-do each other with benefits and perks.
Twitter moved into swanky new office space on Market street in San Francisco last year, complete with a rooftop garden, cafeteria, yoga studio, and arcade. It is rated 4.4 out of 5 stars by its employees and is one of the top five highest paying employers for software engineers. CEO Dick Costolo is a well-known influencer and speaker on issues of leadership  and has an approval rating of 96%.  Twitter’s successful IPO also probably gave a big boost to employee morale.
Companies with at least 1,000 employees had to have at least 50 approved company reviews shared by employees in the past year to be considered.
Glassdoor asks submitters to write reviews for current and previous employers, and companies where they recently interviewed. All submissions to the site are reviewed before they appear to try and keep the information as accurate as possible, and Glassdoor said it rejects between 10 to 15% of content that does not meet its community guidelines. It ‘s data pool contains 5.5 million pieces of content, but since all the content is supplied voluntarily and anonymously, no estimates of theoretical sampling can be calculated.
