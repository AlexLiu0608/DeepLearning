Looking for a $50 pouch for your $1,500 Google Glass ? Google has what you need.
The company last night quietly opened a web store for Glass accessories, which is right now only open to the small number of Glass Explorers.
While the store only has four items at the moment, none of the early accessories are cheap. Extra mono earbuds, for example, will run for $50, the same price Google is asking for extra chargers and carrying pouches. The most expensive item on sale is a protective shield, which runs $75 (and is only compatible with the new Glass hardware the company announced this week .)
The extra microUSB + charger price is especially confusing. Google seems to justify the price by saying that the new plug is “designed specifically for Glass,” though $50 still seems a bit high even for that.
On the other hand, considering how expensive Glass is right now to begin with, perhaps an extra $50 isn’t outrageous. Let’s just hope the prices come down a bit by the time the first batch of consumer Glass units are available.
