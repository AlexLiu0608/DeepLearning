What are the new frontiers of games? What cool tech is coming down the road? How will these best get into the market and get the attention of gamers?
We’ll evaluate emerging game technologies at our  GamesBeat 2013  conference in a breakout session on day two. The event is Oct. 29-Oct. 30 at the Sofitel Hotel in Redwood City, Calif.
Take our poll on your own thoughts about what will be the best emerging game technology.
Here are our panelists:
Sandy Duncan, CEO of YoYo Games
Jan Goetgeluk, CEO of Virtuix, maker of the Omni Treadmill virtual reality platform
Mark Palatucci, chief product officer at Anki
Todd Arnold, vice president of games at Tango
The moderator is Martine Paris, U.S. events editor for Pocket Gamer.
This session fits well with our theme. We’ve entered the Battle Royal, an era where many firms are vying for gamers’ time. Apple and Google want to get in the living room and are waging war against Nintendo and Sony. Microsoft already has an edge in living room entertainment with its Xbox Live service, but it wants a piece of mobile as well. It’s a confusing time for gamemakers. Where should they take their titles? Which platforms will provide the best experiences? Who will make them the most money?
Register here.
We’ll have a steady drumbeat of speakers as we get closer to GamesBeat 2013′s October date. We expect to have more than 80 of the gaming industry’s best lined up for our fifth annual event.
Each year, GamesBeat follows a big trend. In 2009, we focused on how “All The World’s a Game,” with the explosion of games on the global stage. In 2010, GamesBeat@GDC focused on “Disruption 2.0.” In 2011, our theme was “Mobile Games Level Up,” investigating the busy intersection of games and mobile technology. In 2012, we  explored “The Crossover Era ,” the time when so many big game companies and startups were transforming themselves by expanding from one market to the next. Our judges, meanwhile, are already busy picking the finalists in the Who’s Got Game Innovation Showdown for the best game startup.
As companies adapt to change, we’re witnessing disruption, adaptation, consolidation, innovation, and the arrival of big money. We’re talking billions of dollars that are at stake. We’re expecting 400 notables from throughout the game industry — social, mobile, online, and console. Please join us.
