Is your Google Glass not fitting well over your regular glasses? The digital eye wear may one day come with prescription lenses.
Google is working with a major vision benefits and frames-creator VSP Global to figure out how Glass can become a truly mainstream device, according to the Wall Street Journal . VSP’s chief executive Rob Lynch confirmed to the Journal that the company will help Google get Glass inside optometrist offices and actually train those eye doctors to fit people for Google Glass frames.
That means instead of your hot Warby Parkers, you could saunter into your local vision specialist and stick those presciptions straight into device.
Google Glass is a piece of digital equipment you wear on your face like, well, glasses. It projects a small screen in the upper right-hand corner of your field of vision and will eventually support a number of apps, similar to your smartphone, to keep you informed and entertained throughout the day. However, at this point, people aren’t thrilled with the way it looks and especially find the device clunky when paired with existing eye wear.
VSP will also help Google with its fashion sense, rethinking the way the Glass frames really look. It could be that one day you could get your glass device in a number of different styles, something that could make the device more of a fashionable statement piece than a tech-y device.
Thus far, however, the relationship is still just getting off the ground. Google, of course, could simply not put VSP’s thoughts into action.
