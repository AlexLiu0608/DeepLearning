Former PlayStation boss and current Sony Corporation chief executive officer Kazuo Hirai will drop some knowledge in Las Vegas early next year.
The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) revealed that Hirai will give the keynote address at the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES). That event will begin Jan. 7, and Hirai will deliver his talk that morning at 8:30 a.m. local time.
Following the Sony CEO’s speech, CEA chief executive Gary Shapiro will give his State of the Industry Address.
“Sony is a global brand synonymous with innovation and cutting-edge technology,” Shapiro said in a statement. “There is no better way to kick off the world’s greatest innovation event than a keynote from one of the leading brands in the industry, bringing content and technology together to transform the way we live, work, and play. We are thrilled to welcome Kaz Hirai to the 2014 CES keynote stage and are excited to hear his insight surrounding the next generation of consumer technology.”
We’ve reached out to Sony to ask if it will share what Hirai plans to focus on in the address. We’ll update this post with any new information.
Sony’s board of directors appointed Hirai to CEO in April 2012. Previously he headed up Sony Computer Entertainment, the division in charge of PlayStation.
Hirai joined Sony Computer Entertainment America in 1995. He took over SCE, the parent group of SCEA, in 2006.
