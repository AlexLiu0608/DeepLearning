BlackBerry developer “S4BB” is either an app genius or a sultan of spam.
A quick search on the BlackBerry World app store reveals more than 43,000 were created by S4BB , Blackberry site BerryReview points out . That number is particularly damning for BlackBerry, since the company announced in May that its store contained more than 120,000 apps. According to those figures, S4BB alone accounts for a third of BlacKBerry’s apps.
While a handful of S4BB’s apps seem genuinely useful, the rest consist of single-purpose apps like city guidebooks and audiobooks. It seems like a clear effort to spam the BlackBerry store to raise this developer’s profile.
While the company claims it’s seeing more developer interest after the launch of its BlackBerry 10 devices and platform, there isn’t much evidence of that yet. There aren’t any breakout apps built specifically for BlackBerry 10, and the few popular apps on the platform are typically converted Android apps (BB10 lets developers easily repackage their Android apps ).
When asked for comment, multiple RiM spokespeople offered up the following:
Developers in all app stores employ a number of different monetization tactics. BlackBerry World is an open market for developers and we let market forces dictate the success or failure of these tactics. Discoverability in overcrowded stores continues to be an issue affecting all developers. This is why we have worked hand in hand with developers on the Built for BlackBerry program to help showcase apps and games that exemplify the power of BlackBerry 10.
I can’t think of any other company that would let a developer take over its app store with tens of thousands of useless apps. Either BlackBerry’s app vetting process is sub-par, or the company cares more about the quantity of apps available than their quality.
