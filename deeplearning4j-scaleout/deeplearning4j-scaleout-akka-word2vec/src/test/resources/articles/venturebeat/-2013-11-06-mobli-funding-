Social photo service Mobli has raised a handsome new $60 million round of funding, the company announced today.
Mobli is a real-time visual media platform for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone where users can share photos and videos from their smartphones — basically a direct Instagram competitor. It integrates topical channels and location data so its users are only seeing things that interest them or are otherwise relevant. Mobli is one of literally hundreds of social photo sharing services out there, but it does have lots of funding and a lineup of celebrity investors, such as Leo DiCaprio, Lance Armstrong, Tobey Maguire, and Serena Williams.
The new funding comes from América Móvil, the Latin American telecom business run by one of the world’s richest men, Carlos Slim. It seems likely that Mobli will forge a greater partnership with the telecom, which will then make Mobli available to its well over 200 million subscribers.
“The mobile access is significantly enriching our daily lives and is opening the door to completely new experiences for users around the world,” said Slim in a statement. “Mobli has developed a remarkable technology, and this strategic alliance will allow America Movil to bring value added experiences for its users throughout the Americas.”
The startup said it plans to use the funding to enhance its visual search engine, which will allow users to both “see the world through other people’s eyes” and take a look back in time via past photos and videos.
Founded in 2011, the Israel-based startup has raised a total of $88 million to date from Kenges Rakishev, América Móvil, and a sprinkling of celebrities.
