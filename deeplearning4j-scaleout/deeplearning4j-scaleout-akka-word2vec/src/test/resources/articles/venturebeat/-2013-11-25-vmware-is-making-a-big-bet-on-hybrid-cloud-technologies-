VMware ‘s recently launched vCloud service  enables big companies to manage “hybrid” cloud infrastructures — part data center, part public cloud.
We caught up with Matthew Lodge, the vice president of product management and product marketing for cloud services at VMware, to found out more about vCloud, which he oversees.
The cloud focus is new for VMware, which has long dominated server virtualization within data centers but hasn’t ventured into the booming cloud territory — until now.
“Our strategy has really changed to focus on three things,” Lodge said in this video, shot at VentureBeat’s recent CloudBeat conference . Those three things include:
The software defined data center, where not just servers but all data center resources are available as easily configurable, cloud-like services.
The hybrid cloud, because many big companies want to start realizing the benefits of public cloud services but don’t have the luxury of abandoning legacy system.
Mobility, because the shift to mobile devices like smartphones and tablets is the big trend that’s driving the shift to cloud services.
“We’re seeing a lot more interest in hybrid cloud,” Lodge said. “A lot of customers want to move to hybrid cloud because they see that both public cloud and what they have in their data center are going to be coexisting for many years to come.”
It’s an approach calculated to give companies the maximum amount of flexibility and freedom.
“Most of our customers are moving to hybrid cloud because of the agility that it gives them. It’s not necessarily about cost savings,” Lodge said.
In this video, Lodge also talks about why vCloud Hybrid Service supports Pivotal’s Cloud Foundry, in both its proprietary and open-source versions: It gives customers the maximum amount of flexibility to build cloud-independent applications, and let them run those apps on whatever cloud service provider they want.
