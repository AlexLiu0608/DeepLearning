New York-headquartered Shutterstock, one of the world’s largest stock photography providers, is opening a new office in Berlin at the end of the month. The office will be the company’s main European base – its team will be focused on increasing sales in Europe.
Shutterstock’s Communications Director Meagan Kirkpatrick told us that Berlin was the obvious choice for the new office, as Germany is one of the fastest-growing markets for the company.
The city’s entrepreneurial spirit and large talent pool is also an attractive draw: “Berlin has the perfect intersection of creativity and tech”, Kirkpatrick said.
The new office will house customer service, sales and product teams. The team wants to use the Berlin base to gain access to entrepreneurs and creatives in the city —  they’re especially keen to get more work from local and German artists on site.
The Shutterstock Berlin team will also be focused on growing sales, particularly in Eastern Europe, and improving the tech for their mobile app. At the moment, Shutterstock’s only other European office is in London.
Shutterstock is currently working on a new search interface and on expanding new, localised content types. The company, founded in 2003, made an IPO in October 2012.
