StartUp Health has chosen 14 new digital health companies for its three-year long mentorship program, which aims to turn startups into sustainable businesses.
The company made the announcement today at the Cleveland Clinic’s Innovation Summit. Over 1,200 companies applied for the program, which lasts three years and includes virtual workshops, classes, regular summits, and access to a variety of online resources.
Health accelerator programs like RockHealth and HealthBox  offer startup funding and mentorship for a period of three to six months. StartUp Health works a little differently — many of the startups in the new program are later stage and have already raised funding in the form of angel investment, venture capital, and grants .
The startups won’t have to move to a specific location — the companies can live anywhere, and virtually take StartUp Health core curriculum, which consists of 13 modules on customer development, team dynamics, and product design.
StartUp Health’s academy program is highly structured and designed to help startups become sustainable businesses. One of the goals for the first year, for instance, is to connect the founders with potential pilot partners, like a chief information officer of a large hospital network. These partners will often turn into paying customers by the end of the program.
Earlier this year, StartUp Health partnered with GE  as part of its $6 billion Healthymagination initiative. The startups enrolled in the program can take advantage of many of GE’s software and infrastructure for free.
Similarly to an incubator or accelerator program, StartUp Health takes equity — typically, it’s between 2 to 10 percent stock, which is determined on an individual basis.
The startups chosen for the program are:
