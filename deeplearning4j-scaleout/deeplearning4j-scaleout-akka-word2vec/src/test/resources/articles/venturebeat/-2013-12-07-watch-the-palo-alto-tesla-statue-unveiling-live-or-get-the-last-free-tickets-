“This unique project pays respect to a great inventor who never had the historical recognition he deserved,” says project organizer Dorrian Porter in a statement on the news.
“But it also is intended to inspire the entrepreneurs who come to the Silicon Valley to think big and selflessly — as Tesla did — on important opportunities like energy and wirelessly. The free exchange of information and affordable access to sustainable energy have the potential to solve the critical issues of poverty and education and inspire peace.”
