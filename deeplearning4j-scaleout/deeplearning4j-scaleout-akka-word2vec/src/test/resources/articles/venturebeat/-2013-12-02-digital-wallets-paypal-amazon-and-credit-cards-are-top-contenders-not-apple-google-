61 percent of us have heard of digital wallets, but only 11 percent of us have used one, according to a new survey by Forrester. Interestingly, most would rather trust PayPal with their mobile money — rather than their bank or credit card company.
There are three types of mobile wallets, Forrester says: remote-only wallets, proximity-only wallets, and omnichannel digital wallets.
Remote-only wallets, like iTunes or Amazon Checkout, are accessible from virtually any device. By contrast, proximity-only digital wallets are used in-store at point of purchase, typically from your mobile device. Examples include Square Wallet and Apple Passbook — although Passbook currently doesn’t support payments, just the storing of loyalty cards, tickets, and other payment-related data.
Of course, omnichannel wallets, like Google Wallet, PayPal, and MasterPass by MasterCard, support both.
The most-trusted digital wallet? PayPal.
That’s consistent with what we’ve seen in the past year, which is that PayPal is the most recognized and most trusted digital wallet solution , vastly outpacing Google Wallet. Of the 4,000 consumers that Forrester polled, 38 percent said they would trust PayPal with their mobile digital wallet, while banks and credit card companies came in second place, with 35 percent of consumers willing to try their solutions.
Third place goes to Amazon, with 23 percent, which shows that both Apple and Google, the two tech companies that might be best positioned to build and maintain digital wallets due to their extensive dominance of mobile devices and operating systems, don’t place in the top three.
That’s like due to the fact that people don’t associate Apple with digital payments, in spite of iTunes and the app store infrastructure having likely one of the biggest repositories of credit cards on file anywhere on the globe. And Google is late to payments: it  only recently created a set of digital wallet solutions  and started to collect credit cards on Google Play.
