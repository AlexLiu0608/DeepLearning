VentureBeat has a new newsletter for developers: the  ‘Daily Dev’ !
Developers: This is a perfect way to stay up to speed on the latest dev trends and news. You’ll get a mix of dev-centric news, features, analysis, guest columns, and more — all delivered in a neat package every morning.
These roundups will include the programming and software news and commentary you’d expect, as well as alerts on new tools and techniques that might be useful in your daily work.
But we’ll also include items on responsive design, hardware hacking, security vulnerabilities, developer conferences, and even gaming — anything and everything developers might like to know about.
Aside from news, we’ll also be publishing stories about the people behind the software development trends and tools.
