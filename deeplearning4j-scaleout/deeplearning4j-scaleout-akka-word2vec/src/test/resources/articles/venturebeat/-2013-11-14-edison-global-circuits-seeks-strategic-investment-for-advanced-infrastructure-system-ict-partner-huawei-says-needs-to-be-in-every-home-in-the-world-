Advanced Breaker/Meter Gateway System Empowers Utility Companies in       Emerging Markets to Quickly Deliver Improved Communications to a       Targeted 2 Billion Citizens via Existing Electrical Grids Worldwide
HOUSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–November 14, 2013–
Edison Global Circuits (EGC) is actively seeking strategic investment to       support ongoing sales efforts, product line development and production       operations for its Advanced Infrastructure System, new       multi-purpose gateway technology that Huawei ,       whose end-to-end information and communication technologies (ICT)       services make communications possible for one-third of the world’s       population, says “needs to be in every home in the world.”
Ray Cole, CFO of Houston-based EGC, a leading-edge pioneer in electrical       safety and diagnostic systems, says Edison Global Circuits is at the       commercialization stage and ready to provide the right investment team       an equity position in return for strategic investment. “We prefer a       company that has technological experience in the utility space with       worldwide influences, especially in emerging market countries. We expect       to deploy AIS to most, if not all, emerging markets, as well as some       European and North American markets, over time,” Cole said. “The Advanced       Infrastructure System is an all-in-one technology and communications       solution that not only pays for itself, but generates additional revenue       for the government and utility. The market potential can reach upwards       of 2 billion people, putting this opportunity in rare company with other       multi-billion dollar projects.”
Edison Global Circuit’s patented AIS gateway – the only one in the world       that connects directly to circuits already in the home – combines       intelligent home breakers with advanced safety features, measurement & control and a sophisticated communications package designed to make the       home safer and more convenient for living. Seamless multi-way       communication makes it possible for any utility around the world to       provide Internet, TV, phone, security, educational services or any       application that can be delivered wirelessly through existing networks       to the home.
“We are presenting our initial program in Mexico later this month with       the intent to convert every Mexican home to the AIS system and build out       the government’s fiber network so that all existing and new providers       can use it to deliver communications at a fraction of current delivery       costs,” said Cole. “Fully deployed, the system, in conjunction with the       last-mile build out, will require Mexico’s government to make an       investment in their people north of $30 billion. However, the network       has the capability of recapturing these costs with shared revenue       streams and on-going cash flow, which we can easily demonstrate.”
Sales Strategy
EGC will sell to emerging governments through the utility space which         is not only looking to improve its grid structure beyond standard smart meter offerings but also has the authority to install the AIS units         inside each home.
Governments in emerging markets generally control the electrical             grids in their countries, which means EGC can deploy AIS             throughout the country, selling customer by customer via the             government utility.
Most emerging markets have deficiencies in education, middle class             path and cash-to-payments capabilities and governments are looking             for ways to improve the lives of its citizens by providing better             access to communications, education, security or banking services,             among others.
The AIS dual-purpose system receives and distributes any signal to end         devices like a TV or computer in the home without set-top boxes,         routers or hardwiring requirements.
The combination of a last-mile build out and the AIS unit allows any         content provider to deliver services to citizens in a very         cost-effective manner.
Shared gateway revenue ensures the government’s investment of a         last-mile build out is covered by recurring revenue and not on the         backs of its citizens.
“Most of the countries we’ve analyzed have a single or dominant provider       reducing competition and keeping prices artificially high, which       ultimately reduces the country’s GDP. For example, Mexico is losing as       much as $300 million – 2% of its GDP – due to a lack of communications       competition,” Cole said. “These countries have goals to improve the       lives of their citizens by providing access to communications and better       and affordable paths to education without building more schools,       creating a climate of advancement and improved GDP, developing a       payments-based society and introducing competition and lower costs into       the market.”
The Advanced Infrastructure System from Edison Global Circuits       helps governments accomplish these goals in a real and effective manner,       while at the same time providing the government utility with a superior       grid system capable of ending most electrical theft, reducing brown or       blackouts nationwide and making homes safer and more economical. EGC is       working closely with Kahn       Academy to integrate its modernized education platform into country       e-learning initiatives and with its last-mile development partners       Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson Inc.

Meet AIS . . .
“The Advanced Infrastructure System from Edison Global Circuits       is revolutionary and cannot be compared with any smart meter system in       the world today – it needs to be in every home in the world and we plan       to help speed that process,” said Yan Shi, director of Huawei Latin       America’s device product center.
AIS is an extremely cost-effective combination of communications,       access, measurement & control, breaker development and customer       interaction – all in one product – that gives any emerging market       putting the system into production the capability to quickly become a       “smart country,” saving – and generating – millions. The advanced       breaker/meter gateway system is so advanced, affordable and quick to       implement, United       Nations representatives said after reviewing it that AIS likely qualifies as “ country       infrastructure ” and they’d be open to providing long-term funding to       any country that wants to install it.
“AIS is not a meter, but a multi-purpose gateway designed to interact       with utility companies, customers, carriers and content providers by       utilizing existing communications pathways and networks to help       governments and utility companies in emerging countries deliver services       to the home,” said Stephen Williams, EGC CEO. “EGC has been focused on       bringing our Smart Country Infrastructure SystemTM to       billions of underserved populations in developing countries by basically       eliminating the cost in time and resources a government would need to       upgrade its communications infrastructure.”
Key Benefits to Governments and Utilities:
AIS is the only product in the world that connects directly to the         circuits already in the home, which means utilities can reduce theft         up to 80% – that alone pays for the system.
A unique patented feature allows a utility company to shed load         throughout their grid without shutting down individual homes,         preventing brownouts or blackouts and conserves energy.
The AIS powerful gateway feature that allows carriers and content         providers access without wiring the house or providing set-top boxes,         also allows utility companies to share in these newly created revenue         streams.
Fully deployed, implementing the AIS gateway in country can pay for         the entire installation and maintenance of the system.
