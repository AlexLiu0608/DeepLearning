DoubleDutch has raised $10 million to help event organizers go mobile.
The company claims to have created the first-ever social event app. Event organizers use its white-labeled technology to give participants access to an event’s schedule and allow them to create their own agenda. Organizers can embed surveys and polls into the app, facilitate networking, take advantage of sponsorships, and identify sales leads.
People are constantly on their phones at conferences and trade shows, and DoubleDutch helps event owners take advantage of this opportunity.
Experiences that were traditionally offline, like checking schedules, sharing contact information, or asking for feedback, are made digital. This not only adds convenience, but also amps up participant engagement. Attendees can comment on what’s going on, push posts to their social networks, and connect with other people there.
DoubleDutch captures all this data so event organizers can have a better sense of how things are going. It also makes it easy to update content and integrate information with CRMs, CMS, and social media, etc.
Nearly 500,000 event participants use the product, and the company said it is seeing 40 percent quarter-over-quarter growth. Customers include major organizations like SAP, American Express, Box, Cisco, Estée Lauder, the American Heart Association, and Regal Entertainment Group.
This financing will support DoubleDutch’s international expansion, help it grow its line of “data-driven products for exhibitors and organizers,” and help transition the business fully to a software-as-a-service model. When it launched in 2011, it focused on improving worker productivity and enabling better collaboration through paid apps. It is now focusing primarily on event organization.
Bessemer Venture Partners led this round, with participation from existing investors Floodgate, Bullpen Capital and others. It brings the total capital raised to $18.5 million.
DoubleDutch is based in San Francisco and has 60 employees,
