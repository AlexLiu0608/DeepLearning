Apple finally unveiled the successor to its wildly popular iPhone 5 with the new iPhone 5S, the world’s first 64-bit smartphone that features tons of awesome goodies like a fingerprint scanner , updated iOS 7 operating system, and (probably the most useful upgrade) a really slick new camera.
The new camera is packed with lots of useful upgrades, most notably for people who suck at taking pictures (like myself), there’s a new “burst mode” that snaps 10 frames per snap and then automatically identifies what it thinks is the best shot of the bunch.
It also has a dual-color flash built into the smartphone that offers both a cool and warm LED light. Combining these two flashes together enables the iPhone 5S to determine the best flash color based on the setting, which is more good news for people who only casually take pictures (that are usually quite dreadfully shot).
Oh, and there’s also a new Slow-motion video mode that slows down the shot to 120 frames per second.
