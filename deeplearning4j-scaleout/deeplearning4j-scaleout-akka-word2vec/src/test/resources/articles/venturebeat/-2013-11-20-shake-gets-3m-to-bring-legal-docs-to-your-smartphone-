Shake, a mobile-first startup for legal documents, has raised a $3 million first round of institutional funding.
The company’s legal eagles have created its content, which has been “researched and drafted by licensed attorneys to capture important terms concisely and in plain English.”
Documents available on Shake include template forms, letters, and contracts for a variety of scenarios such as independent contracting, hiring a new employee, nondisclosure agreements, rentals, purchase and sale agreements, and personal loans. It also has a DIY option.
Here’s a quick clip with more on how Shake works:
“Legal agreements should be as easy and affordable as doing any other task on your phone – be it taking notes, reserving a car service, or managing your finances,” said Shake CEO and founder Abe Geiger in a statement on the news.
“This new round of funding allows us to further the task of democratizing and simplifying legal agreements using consumer-quality mobile technology. We want every freelancer and small business to be empowered by Shake, and soon, enterprises too.”
SoftBank Capital led the round, which also saw participation from existing investor RRE Ventures, as well as new investors BoxGroup, ENIAC Ventures, Mesa+, WGI Group, and Patrick Keane in the round.
The startup was founded in 2012 and is based in New York City.
