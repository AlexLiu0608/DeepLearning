CyPhy , a company that builds flying robots got $7 million today to, well, build freaking flying robots.
The company creates autonomous flying robots that CyPhy (which stands for cyber-physical) says has unlimited power supply,  high definition video, secure communication to send data back to you, and cannot be “jammed.”
Jamming is an issue for driverless-vehicles and devices because it can throw the technology completely off course, which can be dangerous and costly. Jamming occurs when the robot’s GPS systems are confused by hackers that supply it with false location information.
CyPhy’s founder Helen Greiner is also the president of iRobot, which creates the popular roomba robot vacuum. Greiner explained in a statement that she wants to bring flying robots to the commercial sector in order to help people with “imagine, surveying, mapping, monitoring,” and more.
It has two different types of robots, the EASE robot, which is an indoor hovering robot. The name stands for “extreme access system for entry.” It also created the PARC robot, which is an outdoor multicopter. Its name stands for “persistent aerial reconnaissance and communciations.”
The company is headquartered in Danvers, Mass. The funding comes from Lux Capital with participation from General Catalyst Partners, Felicis Ventures, and unamed angel investors. (Editor’s note: Felicis Ventures’s Aydin Senkut is an investor in VentureBeat .)
