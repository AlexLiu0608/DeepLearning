We’re pleased to announce that Spike TV GTTV host Geoff Keighley will interview John Smedley, president of Sony Online Entertainment at our  GamesBeat 2013  conference on Oct. 29-Oct. 30 in Redwood City, Calif.
SOE
John Smedley, president of Sony Online Entertainment
Keighley will talk to Smedley about the democratization of gaming and the evolution of the online game. SOE is working on Everquest Next , the next installment of the popular massively multiplayer online game series. Smedley will paint the landscape of online games, from the rise of eSports, livecasting, and player-initiated marketing to the growing importance of global communities, player-driven economies, and next-generation gaming.
With Everquest Next, Sony Online Entertainment is putting players in the driver’s seat to game development, as it will allow them for the first time to generate their own content and have it appear both in their own game worlds as well as the large online game world.
Keighley (pictured below) is very well known in the games industry as the host for the weekly GTTV television show on Spike TV. He has spent more than half is life covering the video game business as a journalist, television personality, and producer.

We’ve entered an era where many firms are vying for gamers’ time in the same space. Apple and Google want to get in the living room and are waging war against Nintendo and Sony. Microsoft already has an edge in living room entertainment with its Xbox Live service, but it wants a piece of mobile as well. It’s a confusing time for gamemakers. Where should they take their titles? Which platforms will provide the best experiences? Who will make them the most money?
Register here.
We’ll roll out a steady drumbeat of speakers as we get closer to GamesBeat 2013′s October date. We expect to have more than 80 of the gaming industry’s best lined up for our fifth annual event.
Each year, GamesBeat follows a big trend. In 2009, we focused on how “All The World’s a Game,” with the explosion of games on the global stage. In 2010, GamesBeat@GDC focused on “Disruption 2.0.” In 2011, our theme was “Mobile Games Level Up,” investigating the busy intersection of games and mobile technology. In 2012, we  explored “The Crossover Era ,” the time when so many big game companies and startups were transforming themselves by expanding from one market to the next. Our judges, meanwhile, are already busy picking the finalists in the Who’s Got Game Innovation Showdown for the best game startup.
As companies adapt to change, we’re witnessing disruption, adaptation, consolidation, innovation, and the arrival of big money. We’re talking billions of dollars that are at stake. We’re expecting 400 notables from throughout the game industry — social, mobile, online, and console. Please join us.
