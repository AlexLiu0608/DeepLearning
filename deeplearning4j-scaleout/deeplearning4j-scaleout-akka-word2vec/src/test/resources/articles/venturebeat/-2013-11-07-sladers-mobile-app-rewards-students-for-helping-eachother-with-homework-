One of the best things about being an adult is we don’t have to do homework.
Ed-tech startup Slader released a mobile app today to make homework a less painful part of students’ lives.
Slader is an online network where students can collaborate and help each other with their homework. They join academic classes and find the relevant textbooks. From there students can post homework assignments, pose questions to their peers, and view and share their work.
“Most students hate homework because it just reinforces that they don’t understand; it provides no path to success,” cofounder Kyle Gerrity told VentureBeat. “Slader is a network that helps students in moments of frustration when they’re doing homework. No student wants to be a failure, but they often don’t have the tools available when they need it.”
Slader said it has worked with over 2 million students around the world and helped solve more than 2 million problems to date.
The Internet has created amazing opportunities to move education away from the traditional lecture-in-classroom, homework-at-home format. Education is experiencing a cultural shift right now, largely driven by technology, where interactive, collaborative, experiential learning is emphasized.
Many educators and schools are adopting a”flipped classroom” model. This means students consume information while they are at home and use classroom time to work on assignments The underlying idea is that actual mastery of the material happens while students are working on problems and projects, rather than by passively consuming information.
Slader’s goal is to make working on homework at home more collaborative. The network encourages students to work together to answer their own questions, rather than puzzling over it on their own.
The community writes and votes on all content submitted to the site, so students can both help and receive help from others. They can also engage in online discussions to improve their understanding and hone their thinking.
Gerrity said this is particularly useful for students who are shy about asking questions and sharing their work in a physical classroom, or who live in a household where they don’t have access to homework help.
The new mobile app also includes a form of virtual currency called “Slader Gold” that students earn for solving homework problems and can exchange for real money.
Slader is based in New York City. It was founded by Peter Bernheim, Kyle Gerrity, and Scott Kolb in 2011.
