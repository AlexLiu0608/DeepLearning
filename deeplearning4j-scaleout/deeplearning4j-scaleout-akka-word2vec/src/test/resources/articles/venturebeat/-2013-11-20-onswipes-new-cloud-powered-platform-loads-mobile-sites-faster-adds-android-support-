When it launched in 2011, Onswipe  fed a major need for publishers who wanted a simple way to make their websites mobile-ready. Now, it’s getting even better.
Today, Onswipe announced the latest version of its mobile content platform, which relies heavily on the cloud to crunch content for devices of all sizes. The company also finally added Android support to its platform (again, something that was likely made possible by moving to the cloud).
While Onswipe’s initial concept was immensely useful for publishers, I grew to hate visiting sites using its platform because it was incredibly slow. Previously, Onswipe relied on your device to do most of the work, which meant sites could be a chore to visit if you were stuck with an older iPhone or iPad. The new platform should solve that issue entirely (though I haven’t had a chance to test out any sites using it).
Onswipe recently hired former e-commerce executive Jonty Kelt to serve as its new chief executive, while founder and former CEO Jason Baptiste moved into a chief marketing officer role. The company claims its platform saw more than 27 million unique visits and more than 250 million page views last month.
