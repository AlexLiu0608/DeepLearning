Until the end of the year, Adobe is giving all you design/developer/photographer folks a great bargain on all the Creative Cloud tools you need to do your job well.
If you’ve already got Photoshop CS3 or better, you can get Photoshop CC, Lightroom 5, a Behance ProSite, and 20 GB of storage for $10 per month — and that’s not just a temporary special.
“To be clear, $9.99 is not an introductory price,” Adobe employee Winston Hendrickson wrote in a blog post on the news. “It is the price for those of you who sign up by December 31, 2013.”
The usual price for single-application subscriptions is $20 per month.
The company said its Creative Cloud customers had been asking for a special bundle just for photographers. The news was announced at the Adobe Photoshop World conference in Las Vegas.
Creative Cloud is Adobe’s replacement for Creative Suite and its transition to web-enabled features, workflows, teamwork tools, and syncing for all its design and development software.
