While Apple unveiled its iOS 7 operating system back in June, what the company didn’t say is when iOS users would actually be able to get their (figurative) sweaty mitts on the update. Until now, anyway.
At Apple’s press event today, Apple said that it plans to ship the update on Sept. 18 – a little over a week from today.
Apple CEO Tim Cook is confident that once Apple releases iO7, tons of iPhone and iPad users will actually take the time to update their devices ( unlike with that other operating system ). “And since we make updates easy … iOS 7 will quickly become the world’s most popular operating system,” Cook said.
In addition to its flashy, almost mesmerizing new design, iOS 7 offers 200 new features, including new voices for Siri, improved multitasking, and support for iTunes Radio.
