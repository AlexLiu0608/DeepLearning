You probably already know this, but Facebook is down.
Well, mostly. While the site seems to be largely functional, many users are complaining this morning of being unable to make status updates and post on friends’ walls.
While there’s no comment from Facebook on what’s causing the issues, the company does confirm on its Platform Status page that its Payments platform  has been down since 4:50am PDT.
More telling, perhaps, is the chart below, which shows a surge in both Facebook error messages and API response times this morning.
Pictorial proof that a whole bunch of people are having the same Facebook problem you are.
Update: Here’s how Facebook explained the situation in a statement to VentureBeat.
Earlier this morning, while performing some network maintenance, we experienced an issue that prevented some users from posting to Facebook for a brief period of time. We resolved the issue quickly, and we are now back to 100%. We’re sorry for any inconvenience we may have caused.
Perhaps expectedly, disgruntled Facebook users are taking to Twitter to complain about the outage, leading to the surge in popularity of hashtags like #RIPFacebook and  #GetWellSoonFacebook . Welcome to 2013.
As always it’s easy to poke fun at how quickly something as insignificant as a Facebook outage sends the world into a frenzy, but that’s the wrong way to look at it:  Facebook is a public company now, so any widespread outages it experiences can be translated into very real dollars and cents.
