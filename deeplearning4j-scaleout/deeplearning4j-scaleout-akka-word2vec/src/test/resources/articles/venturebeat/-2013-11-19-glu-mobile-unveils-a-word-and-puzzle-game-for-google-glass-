Signaling its advance into new turf, mobile developer Glu Mobile announced today that it has developed a word game, Spellista , for the Google Glass wearable device.
Unveiled today at Google’s Glass event in San Francisco, Spellista is an interactive word and puzzle game designed for the Google Glass GDK beta program and includes exclusive features created by Glu’s Android team.
Glu Mobile is a mobile game publisher known for titles like Deer Hunter. This is its first game for Google Glass, and it’s a sign that mobile developers are taking note of so-called “smart glasses.” This isn’t the first game for Glass, but Glu is one of the first of the big mobile publishers to create something for it.
In Spellista, two players solve can work together to solve word scrambles in nine stages or make their own puzzle levels to share with friends on Glass. It uses peer-to-peer messaging and voice tutorial capability.
“Spellista represents a major shift in interactive digital content, and we are proud to support Google as a Glass beta partner,” said Niccolo de Masi, the CEO of Glu Mobile. “The opportunity to develop for Glass exemplifies Glu’s technology strength and commitment to creating original content for innovative platforms.”
Spellista uses the Glass gyroscope, accelerometer, camera, and voice recognition while also providing a sharable experience. Players can use head controls for nearly hands-free gameplay. Glu also developed Glass-to-Glass sharing, allowing players to create and send new levels to other users through the Glass camera and voice recognition.
“We value the customer’s experience on the platform and Google’s effort to offer consistency across applications,” said Sourabh Ahuja, Glu’s VP of cross-platform development. “We worked closely with Google to ensure that Spellista adheres to the Glass experience and feels native to Glassware.”
“Spellista turns gameplay into an instant communication platform by letting anyone make personalized, interactive content for their friends and family,” said Lian Amaris, Spellista’s executive producer. “When players create unique puzzles for each other, the game becomes communal in a timely and meaningful way. If I’m on a flight or in a waiting room, playing a level made just for me by a loved one keeps us connected in that moment through gameplay.”
