For example, if you’ve downloaded Supercell’s Clash of Clans but have left your warriors abandoned, lonely, and sad for weeks, Supercell might try to get you back to the game via a mobile ad spot that, hopefully, would catch your attention and trigger an action: playing Clash of Clans.
“Now mobile app ads can keep existing users active within your app, even after they install,” Facebook says.
The deep-linked content could also be a promotion or sale. Facebook says that hotel-booking site HotelTonight has already used that feature to tempt customers into booking a last-minute getaway. Other potential uses, Facebook says, include telling gamers that there’s a new level now available, showcasing new playlists on a music app, perhaps from celebrities, or highlighting new sales or promotions in a retail app.
Interestingly, the ad itself — and Facebook — don’t completely know whether or not you have the advertised apps installed already on your mobile device. When you tap on an ad, the device itself will determine whether the app is already installed, and if it is, the deep link will take you right to the promised content.
If not, the ad will lead you to the appropriate app store to download and install the app.
“With these new features, mobile app ads now offer an end-to-end solution that helps businesses drive awareness, acquire new users, and increase engagement,” Facebook said.
