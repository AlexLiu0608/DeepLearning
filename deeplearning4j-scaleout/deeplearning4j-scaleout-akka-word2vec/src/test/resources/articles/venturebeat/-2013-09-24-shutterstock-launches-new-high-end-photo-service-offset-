Shutterstock is rolling out a high-end version of its stock photography service that focuses on more artistic images, the company announced today.
Shutterstock provides organizations with royalty-free stock images and photography that can be used for advertisements, artwork, promotions, and general editorial purposes. The company, which has 550,000 paying customers, currently has more than 19 million royalty-free images available in a variety of sizes and file types, such as the larger .tiff and vector images that print publications need. [Disclosure: Shutterstock provides VentureBeat with a limited number of images for free.]
By contrast, Shutterstock’s new service, called Offset , will mostly contain images from established artists. Initially, Offset has 45,000 images from over 100 artists and notable collections at launch, including work from David duChemin, Gentl and Hyers, National Geographic, and Cavan Images. And since this is a service that targets legitimately recognized artwork, Offset’s pricing is a notch higher than what you’d pay at most stock image services. Smaller files are currently priced at $250, while larger files are $500.
My guess is that this will be the service people prefer if they just want some artwork to match a particular project, but don’t really want to alter an image very much. (I say that because the regular Shutterstock service is very useful to graphic designers when illustrating an advertising spot or some kind of promotional material.)
