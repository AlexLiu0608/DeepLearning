The world’s top PC maker is also really good at selling smartphones and tablets.
Alongside its strong third quarter earnings , Lenovo said it sold 29 million devices last quarter — or four devices per second.  Sustaining a trend started last quarter , the majority of those devices were tablets and smartphones, not PCs.
That’s a big transition for the company, which has seen major growth in its PC business even as just about every other PC maker has floundered. As of last quarter, Lenovo claimed 17.7 percent of the PC market — a new high.
But while Lenovo’s tablet and smartphone sales have overtaken those of its PCs, it’s the company’s laptops that still bring in the most cash: Lenovo says that 51 percent of its overall revenue ($5 billion) came from laptop sales. Desktop revenue, in contrast, was $2.7 billion, representing 28 percent of overall revenue. Lenovo’s tablet and smartphone business pulled in $1.5 billion.
In all, Lenovo earned $220 million on $9.8 billion in revenue, the latter of which increased 13 percent year-over-year.
Lenovo’s earnings come a week after the company announced the Yoga Tablet , its latest experiment with modular, foldable hardware. The company also announced its latest Yoga laptops back in September , as well as its Vibe X smartphone.
