VoIP and video conferencing startup FuzeBox has raised a $26 million round of funding, the company announced today.
FuzeBox’s application lets enterprise clients conduct live video meetings using virtually any device/operating system. All screens involved in the collaboration are synced up so that participants see the same thing at the same time. And it offers users such tools as zoom and a laser-pointer during their meeting as well as the ability to upload and access documents, graphics, videos, presentations, and audio files. FuzeBox’s clients include Evernote and Ogilvy.
FuzeBox will use the additional capital to build out a new freemium business model, which will essentially open up its service to individuals and small businesses. It will also use the money to hire more employees and expand into Europe.
In addition to the funding news, FuzeBox announced it has hired David Obrand as its new CEO and has added former Yammer executives Mary Pecka, Georg Ell, and Jonathan Grant to the team.
Founded in 2009, the San Francisco, Calif.-based startup previously raised a $20 million round of funding last year and has raised a total of $46 million to date. The latest round was led by Hermes Growth Partners and Index Ventures, with participation from Khosla Ventures, Insight Venture Partners, TriplePoint Ventures, and others. FuzeBox competes directly with Cisco, GoToMeeting, and many others.
