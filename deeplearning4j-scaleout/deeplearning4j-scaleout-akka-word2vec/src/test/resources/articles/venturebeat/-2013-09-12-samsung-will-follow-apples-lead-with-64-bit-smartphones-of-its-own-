“Not in the shortest time. But yes, our next smartphones will have 64-bit processing functionality,” Samsung mobile business head JK Shin told the Korea Times .
While Apple’s 64-bit A7 processor (which is two times as fast as the previous A6) sounds like it has marginal utility in a smartphone, the company hopes to put it to good use in demanding applications like high-end games and video editing. During its presentation on Tuesday, A pple used the 5S to run the latest Infinity Blade, which features the kind of impressive visuals rarely seen on today’s smartphones.
As far as Samsung goes, though, it seems that while the company is intent on going the 64-bit route at some point, it’s not clear how far off its first 64-bit phone actually is. Also, it remains to be seen how long it takes Android developers to make apps that actually take advantage of a more advanced processor. Android has a big enough fragmentation problem as it is.
The real takeaway, though, is this: For most people, the number of bits or cores or processors in their phones is almost entirely irrelevant. Considering that the age of specs is largely over, we can expect the discussion of the merits of 64-bit smartphones to disappear as soon as it appeared.
