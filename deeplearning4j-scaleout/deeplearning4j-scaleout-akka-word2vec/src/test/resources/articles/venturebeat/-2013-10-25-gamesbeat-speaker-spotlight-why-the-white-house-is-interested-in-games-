Mark DeLoura, White House advisor on games and digital media
A former game developer who worked at tech leadership positions at Sony, Nintendo, Google, Ubisoft, and THQ, DeLoura is now the senior advisor on digital media for the White House Office of Science and Technology. That means he’s responsible for keeping the White House informed on what is happening in the video game industry and what the government should be doing when it comes to interacting with the industry.
We’ll interview Deloura in a fireside chat at our  GamesBeat 2013  conference. The event is Oct. 29-Oct. 30 at the Sofitel Hotel in Redwood City, Calif.
The topics we’ll cover include the administration’s interest in games and apps for education, health and fitness, second-language learning, and crowdsourced citizen science. We’ll talk about how federal agencies are using games and game technologies, and the challenges and opportunities in developing games for impact. Why are analytics important for learning games, and why does coding literacy matter? How can you get involved? We’ll also touch on the state of game-related research, including the state of neuroscience investigations and — this may not surprise you — violent media discussions.

We’ve entered the Battle Royal, an era where many firms are vying for gamers’ time. Apple and Google want to get in the living room and are waging war against Nintendo and Sony. Microsoft already has an edge in living room entertainment with its Xbox Live service, but it wants a piece of mobile as well. It’s a confusing time for gamemakers. Where should they take their titles? Which platforms will provide the best experiences? Who will make them the most money?

We’ll have a steady drumbeat of speakers as we get closer to GamesBeat 2013′s October date. We expect to have more than 80 of the gaming industry’s best lined up for our fifth annual event.
Each year, GamesBeat follows a big trend. In 2009, we focused on how “All The World’s a Game,” with the explosion of games on the global stage. In 2010, GamesBeat@GDC focused on “Disruption 2.0.” In 2011, our theme was “Mobile Games Level Up,” investigating the busy intersection of games and mobile technology. In 2012, we  explored “The Crossover Era ,” the time when so many big game companies and startups were transforming themselves by expanding from one market to the next. Our judges, meanwhile, are already busy picking the finalists in the Who’s Got Game Innovation Showdown for the best game startup.
As companies adapt to change, we’re witnessing disruption, adaptation, consolidation, innovation, and the arrival of big money. We’re talking billions of dollars that are at stake. We’re expecting 400 notables from throughout the game industry — social, mobile, online, and console. Please join us.
