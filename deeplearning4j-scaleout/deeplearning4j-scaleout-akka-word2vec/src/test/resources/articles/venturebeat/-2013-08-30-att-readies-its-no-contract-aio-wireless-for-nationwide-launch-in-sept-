Aio Wireless, the pre-paid contract free service from No. 2 major U.S. carrier AT&T, is preparing for a nationwide launch next week, AT&T announced yesterday.
Aio Wireless is basically AT&T’s answer to rival carrier T-Mobile’s strategy to start offering contract-free mobile data plans to its customers as a way to differentiate itself from others.
Right now Aio Wireless is only available in a handful of regions, including Atlanta, Chicago, Florida, and Texas, but that’s set to change as of Sept. 1 when everyone across the country will have access to the service.
AT&T’s Aio service will range in price from about $40 to $70 per month, which includes a data plan at 4G LTE speeds and a set number of minutes and text messages. The selection of devices include those from Samsung, Nokia, and others, and customers can trade in eligible devices for an in-store credit towards a new device.
