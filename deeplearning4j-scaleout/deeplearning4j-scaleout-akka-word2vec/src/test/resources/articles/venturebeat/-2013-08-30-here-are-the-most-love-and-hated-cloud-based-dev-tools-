We’re on a mission to find and rate the 10 best cloud-based tools for developers .
So far, we’ve surveyed 150 devs; their responses have been unexpected and enlightening.
For example, did you know that Windows Azure is one of the most popular tools around? It’s also one of the most disliked, followed by Parse and Urban Airship — two big surprises.
The undisputed favorite among devs is Github, with Heroku and New Relic coming in a distant second and third.
Here’s a colorful look at the survey results so far. We’re entering the final round of survey collection, so be sure to enter your responses now ! Just remember, this isn’t a popularity contest, so only vote for tools you’ve actually used yourself.
In just a couple weeks, we’ll be releasing our full report with detailed findings, so stay tuned for more!
Editor’s note: A lot of these companies will be present at CloudBeat 2013 and DevBeat 2013 , VentureBeat’s conferences for cloud and developer topics. Both shows will happen this fall in San Francisco, so be sure to register today!
VentureBeat is creating an index of the most exciting cloud-based services for developers . Take a look at our initial suggestions and  complete the survey  to help us build a definitive index. We’ll publish the official index later this month, and for those who fill out surveys, we’ll send you an expanded report free of charge.  Speak with the analyst who put this survey together to get more in-depth information,  inquire within .
