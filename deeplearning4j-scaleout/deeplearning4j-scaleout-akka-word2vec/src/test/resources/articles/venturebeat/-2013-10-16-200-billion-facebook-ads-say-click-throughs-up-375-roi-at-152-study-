But clickthroughs aren’t the only numbers that are up — costs are, too.
Cost-per-thousand (CPM) impressions for retailers advertising in Facebook are up almost as much as clickthroughs: 271 percent. Today, they’re $.89, while in 2012 they were just $.33. Interestingly, Nanigans, which is one of the largest ad buyers on Facebook, sees a big 37 percent spike in ad costs during the last month of each quarter.
“This is likely due to heightened demand for inventory at this time as brands and agencies rush to meet quarterly volume goals,” the company said.
While CPM costs are up, cost per click (CPC) are down, dropping 27 percent in the last year, and Nanigans says they’re “normalizing” at around $0.45.

News feed ads are taking over from righthand-side ads.
The most important numbers, however, are not CPM or CPC. Instead, they’re ROI. If retailers are making money advertising, they’ll do it regardless of the cost. And according to Nanigans — which, of course, sells Facebook ads — ROI is at 152 percent, meaning that every dollar spent on Facebook advertising generates $1.52 in sales. And that number, Nanigans says, is low, because the report date range cuts off some sales that will still be attributable to ads that were shown in previous months — advertising in one month, in this case September, will often result in some sales still in the next month, in this case October.
And ROI is all about targeting the right person with the right ad at the right time.
“We can get an ad to any human being on the planet,” says Slagen, exaggerating just slightly. “But it has to be one that they take action on.”
News feed ads are clearly taking over Facebook.
From Q1 this year to Q3, the percent of Facebook ads that were delivered to the news feed versus the righthand side grew from just 35 percent to 74 percent, almost three quarters. In September, that was even more exaggerated: 79 percent of ads on Facebook for retailers were in the news feed.
Interestingly, when Nanigans looked at how retailers are allocating their budget on Facebook desktop ads, an ad type that didn’t even exist earlier this year is leading the way: unpublished page posts.
Unpublished page posts are “posts” that are not posted to be viewed organically by those who have liked a brand — it’s an area only used for advertising. From nothing in February, this ad type has exploded to 68 percent in September. Meanwhile, ads that link to an external domain are down from a majority early in 2013 to under 20 percent today.
Mobile app installs have also grown.
Nanigans also looked at the demographics of Facebook advertising, finding that men click on more ads than women, and buy less frequently, providing 26 percent less ROI. In other words, painting with a very broad counter-cultural brush, men shop, and women buy.
In addition, while Facebook advertisers focus on younger audiences, older Facebook users provide much more return on investment — up to double.
