Project S: An inexpensive phablet with killer specs
The race is on to build the best smartphone at the lowest off-contract price. And with its $299 Project S phone, Taiwanese manufacturer Bungbungame may just have a solid contender. The Android smartphone sports a huge 5.8-inch display with a sharp 2,560 by 1,440 resolution, an octa-core processor, and a 16 megapixel camera.
While intriguing, the Project S is still very much a concept. Bungbungame is kicking off an Indiegogo campaign to build the phone, where it hopes to raise $5 million. The company has also produced some low-cost Android tablets. The Project S will compete with other powerful-yet-cheap phones from China’s Xiaomi , as well as Google’s latest Nexus phones.
In my brief hands-on time with the Project S, it certainly didn’t feel cheap. It’s all sharp edges and obsidian black (indeed, the edges were a bit too sharp for comfort). It also sports a glass rear, which may be a particularly unwise choice for such a large phone.
