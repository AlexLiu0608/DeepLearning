The normally tight-lipped Apple let one announcement slip ahead of its Tuesday media event.
GarageBand will be offered as a free app for iOS 7 devices, according to a report from MacRumors . On Sunday, the publication spied some changes to the iPhone 5S  Built-in Apps page  that point to a “freemium” model for the mobile GarageBand app.
Here’s the text (since pulled by Apple):
GarageBand is free on the App Store for all iOS 7 compatible devices; additional GarageBand instruments and sounds are available with an in-app purchase. iPhoto, iMovie, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote are free on the App Store for qualifying iOS 7 compatible devices activated on or after September 1, 2013.
Apple offered those other iLife and iWork apps as free downloads alongside the release of iOS 7, but GarageBand remained a paid app ($4.99), presumably due to licensing fees.
At its press event tomorrow, Apple is expected to unveil new designs and functionality for its iWork and iLife apps, alongside iPad, Mac Pro, and OS X Mavericks announcements. See this prediction piece from VentureBeat’s John Koetsier for more on what to expect tomorrow.
GarageBand for iOS lets you play, record, and mix instruments.
