Systems in Motion (SIM), a provider of technology consulting and solutions for enterprises, knows its customers are hungry to capitalize on the mountains of data stored away in their servers. So to bolster its internal data offerings, the company purchased social analytics toolmaker Claritics, it announced this morning. It did not disclose the terms of the deal.
Founded in 2010, Mountain View, Calif.-based Claritics operates a cloud-based platform that analyzes social, mobile, and web data in real time. The resulting “social intelligence” enables app developers and product managers to better obtain, engage, and monetize their user base, according to the company.
Claritics has focused heavily on social game makers and enterprise gamification. The company recently teamed up with Badgeville to bring its analytics to that gamification platform, and it also provides services to game development studios like TheBroth and Six Foot Kid. Claritics competes with Kissmetrics and Mixpanel in games as well as Omniture and Webtrends in the broader analytics business.
Claritics’ offering also enables smarter, faster marketing using advanced segmentation, CEO and cofounder Raj Pai told VentureBeat.
“For example, a marketing manager can create a specific segment of users based on any number of attributes — ranging from demographics and in-app behaviors to social, mobile, and web behaviors — and then save these segments as specific lists that get dynamically updated as new users come on board,” said Pai. “So with just a single click, the marketing manager can pull up the list later and send targeted messaging to engage with specific user groups.”
The Newark, Calif.-based Systems in Motion, meanwhile, was founded in 2009 and offers services like domestic outsourcing, IT consulting, and app management to U.S. enterprises. Some of its customers include Thomson Reuters, Alltel, Magellan, and Zephyr.
“SIM’s customers are looking for real-time analytics, data discovery, and data mining solutions,” said Jay Bala, Claritics’ chief technology officer and cofounder, in a statement.
Following the acquisition, Bala will lead System in Motion’s big data lab, and Pai will serve as its strategic advisor.
