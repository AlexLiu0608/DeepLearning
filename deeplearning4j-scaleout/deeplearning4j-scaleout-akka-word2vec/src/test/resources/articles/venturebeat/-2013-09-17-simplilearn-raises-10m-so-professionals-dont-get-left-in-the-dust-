In a competitive job market, Simplilearn helps people get the training they need to keep up.
Today, Simplilearn announced securing $10 million in its second round of financing. The company claims to be the world’s largest certification training provider for working professionals.
Simplilearn offers a mix of classroom and online courses that help people get accreditations and approvals for skill sets they need for their career. It offers over 80 certification courses and has trained 75,000 professionals in 150 countries around the world.
Categories include project management, agile and scrum certification, IT service management, big data and cloud computing, IT security management, finance management, quality management, SAP certification, CompTIA certification, Microsoft certification, and Cisco certification.
Dozens of online education portals, such as Udacity, Udemy, and Lynda.com, offer practical training. Simplilearn’s niche is focusing on corporate certification. Rather than catering to individuals looking to boost their resumes, it focuses on businesses that want their current employees to develop their professional skill sets.
The tech world moves fast. A degree or certification received 10 years ago is often no longer relevant for certain positions. Companies need to make sure that their employees are up-to-date on the latest technology if they want to stay competitive.
During a panel on education at TechCrunch Disrupt , Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) said that the old model of education no longer works and online education can help prevent the “skills gap” from widening.
“Are we as a system of higher learning prepared to advance workforce development — the human capital for the workforce of today, let alone for the future? The skills gap is winding in real time, and we can’t afford to fail,” Newsom said. “In five to 10 years, education expires, and everything is new again. There can’t be a single stage of education anymore. Learning should happen over the course of your life.”
Simplilearn is part of this movement. People don’t necessarily have to go back to school to keep their skills sharp in an accessible and convenient way.
The company has grown by 400 percent since early last year. This funding will help it diversify and expand its course catalog, add more employees in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Middle East, and roll out mobile apps.
Helion Venture Partners and Kalaari Capital led this second round.
