Windows 8 combines the fun of a tablet with the productivity of a PC, says InTouch . Which must mean a whole lot of fun is bound up in the massive 1080p INF7011, a 70-inch, touch-enabled Windows PC.
The massive PC, dubbed BigTouch, will likely hang on a wall and be used for meetings and group events. It supports up to five touch points, so you can use all your fingers, or multiple people can touch their work at the same time.
This is the “small” 55-inch version:
It’s got an internal Intel core i5 processor, a “fast” 120GB solid state drive like a tablet or a MacBook Air, 4GB RAM, and just about as many ports as anyone would ever want: HDMI, ethernet, a 3.5mm sound input jack, no less than seven USB type A slots and one USB type B slot, VGA, and, yes, fast WiFi.

InTouch customer “service”
It also is remarkable for what it doesn’t have: a set price.
I called an InTouch representative who told me I needed to request a quote for BigTouch and that he could not tell me the price. That was after, of course, about 10 minutes on the phone and a failed attempted to get customer service online.
If, however, difficulties in actually getting in touch with the company do not matter to you, and you simply must have a bigger PC than the Jones down the street, BigTouch might be just the ticket.
“BigTouch makes meetings and lessons more engaging, interactive, and fun,” the company says.
