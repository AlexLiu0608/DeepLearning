The iPhone 5C leaks just keep piling in.
The latest photos show what appears to be the iPhone 5C, Apple’s rumored cheaper iPhone with multi-colored plastic cases, in clear packaging similar to the iPod Touch. Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 5C, along with a revamped iPhone 5S (with a new gold color option ), at a media event on September 10.
With the most recent leaks, the iPhone 5C’s existence seems more and more certain. We’ve seen videos and photos showing off the 5C’s rear plastic shell , all of which look polished enough to bear the Apple name. And with mounting competition from Chinese smartphone makers like Xiaomi and slowing sales in China , Apple needs a cheaper phone that can compete in that country and other international markets.
