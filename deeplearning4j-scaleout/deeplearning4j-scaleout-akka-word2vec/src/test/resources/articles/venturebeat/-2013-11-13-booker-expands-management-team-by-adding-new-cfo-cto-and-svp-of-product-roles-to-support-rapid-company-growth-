Financial Leadership
Bill Smith, Chief Financial Officer, is a seasoned financial       expert with more than 20 years of broad finance experience, including       corporate finance, capital markets, mergers & acquisitions, and investor       relations. Bill was most recently CFO of Antenna Software, Inc., a       leading mobile solutions platform provider, until its sale to       Pegasystems, Inc. in October 2013. Prior to that, he was CFO of KAYAK       Software, Inc., the leading travel search and booking website.
“I’m excited to join the leader in cloud-based services management,”       said Bill Smith, Chief Financial Officer of Booker. “With Booker’s       growth on track for another record year, business momentum is strong,       and I look forward to helping guide Booker to continued financial       success.”
Technological Leadership
“With great leaders, we can build world-class products that attract and       retain our customers,” added McCarter. “Both Russ and Mike have the       proven ability to solve SMB problems, build best-in-class enterprise       solutions, and prioritize the many varied demands placed on our product       and development teams.”
Russell Cherry, Chief Technology Officer, is tasked with the       delivery of Booker’s product vision, execution on enterprise       commitments, and technical operations of the Booker Platform. Cherry       joins Booker from GSI Commerce (now eBay Enterprise), where he spent the       last ten years. He was responsible for the creation and delivery of a       $10M annual product roadmap with significant investments in site search,       multichannel commerce, and mobile enablement.
“I am so excited to join this creative and energetic team that embraces       such a ‘can-do’ attitude every day,” said Russell Cherry, Booker Chief       Technology Officer. “I have always been attracted to roles where I can       have measurable impact, but more importantly, I am attracted to       companies that provide services or products that truly add value to our       clients. Booker is one of those companies.”
Mike Sommers, Senior Vice President of Product, will develop       Booker’s product strategy and roadmap. Sommers brings more than 15 years       of experience creating innovative business and consumer software       products across a variety of platforms, including local, social, search,       video and mobile. Prior to joining Booker, Mike was Chief Product       Officer at WeWork, where his team developed the property management       system used to manage over 5,000 collaborative office spaces across       eight locations in the U.S., as well as the social networking platform       used by all WeWork members to connect, communicate, and collaborate with       each other on a daily basis. Prior to WeWork, Sommers played a key role       in the executive team that built KickApps and sold the company to KIT       Digital.
“I was attracted to Booker for a few reasons,” said Mike Sommers, Senior       Vice President of Product. “First, Josh assembled an impressive       management team whose talent and deep industry knowledge have positioned       Booker as a solid leader in the service management space. Second, I       appreciated the vision to provide service-based businesses with a local       operating system that combines daily operations, automated marketing,       and actionable analytics into a single, easy-to-use platform in the       cloud. Third, Booker has seen tremendous growth and traction over the       past few years, both in terms of revenue and headcount. It is clear to       me that Booker is a great company where talented people want to work and       has a great product that thousands of small businesses love to use.”
