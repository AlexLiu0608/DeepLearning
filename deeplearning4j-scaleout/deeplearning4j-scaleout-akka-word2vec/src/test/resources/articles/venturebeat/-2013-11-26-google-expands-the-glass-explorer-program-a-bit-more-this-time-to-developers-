Developers eager to help Google create the future of wearables may soon have their chance.
Google is now inviting developers to purchase their own Google Glass units , a move that expands the Glass Explorer Program beyond just a small set of early adopters. The $1,500 price for Glass, however, remains the same.
The move comes after Google opened up Glass’s Mirror API and previewed the Glass Developer Kit, the latter of which will finally let developers plug into some of Glass’s more powerful hardware features.
Alongside the developments, Google also showed off new Glass apps from Strava, AllTheCooks, and others . While the apps were impressive in their own right, they also showed just how powerful — and useful — Glass can be when Google opens it up to people who can create things for it.
In other words, the more developers Google gets playing with and developing for Glass, the better Glass will ultimately be.
