Grand Theft Auto games have always been too heavy on the open world, too light on the story for me. But that changed  with this title and its three main characters, Franklin, Michael, and Trevor. Each of them came from a very different part of the imaginary open world of Los Santos, but their tales were interwoven in a way that exposed the full spectrum of adventures available to the player.
Trevor, for instance, was a seasoned pilot. Michael was a connected hood. And Franklin was a driving virtuoso. The side characters who supported them made it possible to pull off some truly legendary heists in the game. The satire and parodies on the car radio had me laughing too, as did the soundtracks that played when you were driving with different characters.
The designers were astute to include Trevor because he freed the player to do some really nasty acts without remorse. After all, if you were playing Trevor, you knew he was a crazy character and anything bad that you did while playing Trevor would be completely defensible as role-playing. That wasn’t me stomping on that guy’s face. That was Trevor, not me. That was liberating for the player. But Trevor’s presence was also quite disturbing, leading to controversial scenes like one where the player has no choice but to torture a hapless foe.
The dilemma for the player is how the game requires you to be  irredeemably evil , or face that fact that you have to be a bloody bastard to be successful as a criminal in the city of Los Santos and complete the story as it unfolds toward its climax. GTA V convinced me that it is OK to lose yourself in a video game character, to perform heinous acts as that video game character, and still emerge as a human being.
This had some real dramatic moments, like when two key characters pull guns on each other in a stand-off. At the same time, the world was expansive enough for you to spend well over 100 hours exploring it in all of its dimensions. The balance of story, open world, and multiplayer combat gave something for everybody — except for the casual gamer who hates extreme violence.
I felt it went astray in the relatively routine ending (or the ending that I felt offered the clearest choice of three ending options) for the final mission of 69 available to the gamer. If you compare it to the endings of BioShock Infinite and The Last of Us, it seems like it was just such an average way to close an epic story. It reminded me that this story could be viewed as a very pedestrian episode on a TV crime show. That’s why it’s not my No. 1 choice.
Grand Theft Auto V reportedly cost $260 million to make over five years. Some would say that it is madness to spend so much time and money developing a game in this era. But with $1 billion in sales generated in three days, GTA V essentially made up for its costs in about 18 hours of sales. I would be quite sad to wait until 2018 to get another Grand Theft Auto game, but I can understand why Rockstar does what it does and takes nobody’s advice.
