Here are today’s funding news stories:
Skybox takes $3.3M
In a Form D filing with the SEC, security startup Skybox announced it’s taken $3.3 million in funding. The San Jose, Calif.-based company “provides risk analytics for enterprise security management,” according to a self-description, and was founded in 2002. To date, the startup has taken a total of five rounds of funding, bringing its lifetime raise to $16.8 million.
Chinese incubator BitChemy shells out $6M
It’s two millies apiece for three lucky startups incubated at China’s BitChemy Ventures ! The winning roundup includes Cafyne (enterprise social media management), 3loq (mobile marketing), and Altilux (mobile-to-mobile, Internet of things). The firm, founded in 2012, emailed VentureBeat to say, “Our parent company has a turnover of over $1 billion and operates in more than 10 countries and 8 industry sectors. We combine entrepreneurship, incubation, and seed capital with operational management and strategic oversight.”
Teambox doubles down on $6.8M round
RedBooth, the company behind Teambox, has filed with the SEC regarding some follow-on funding. Back in October , the RedBooth folks tied up a $5 million round. Today’s filing shows that for this round, with the first sale occurring in October, the final sale amount has increased to around $6.8 million. As you might guess by the name, Teambox is a workplace tool for file sharing, collaboration, and task management. The company, founded in 2009, was formerly of Barcelona and is now based in Redwood City, Calif.
Sprig’s $800M mystery money
After announcing a $1.2 million raise last month, food delivery startup Sprig filed a new Form D with the SEC today. We see from the filing that Sprig has received $500,000 of a proposed $800,000 equity sale. What we don’t (yet) know is whether this is follow-on funding (we’ll hazard a guess: it is) or the beginnings of a new round. The San Francisco-based company is helmed by Udemy founder Gagan Biyani, the sole party named in the form.
