CUPERTINO, Calif. — Apple launched two new iPhones today, and we got some quality time with both of ‘em.
Of these two devices, we actually found the cheaper 5C a greater pleasure to handle. Its gorgeously smooth plastic surface made us feel like we were caressing some mythical sea creature, silky and cool.
And this reporter isn’t even an iPhone fan.
The iPhone 5S, on the other hand, felt like … just another iPhone. The biometric features, graphics rendering for games, and new camera will have to be the big selling features for current iPhone users, but we doubt this will be enough to woo current Android/Windows users over to the dark side.
Here’s a close-up look. You can also check out our video of the iPhone 5S and the 5S side-by-side with a Windows Phone .
