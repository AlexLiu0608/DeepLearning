Today’s average smartphone offers more computing power than the combined power of every computer NASA used to send humans to the moon in 1969. We are able to consume immense amounts of information anywhere, any time, as well as produce loads of data every second. This is data about our consumption, but it also contains context on how, when, and where we use our personalized applications.
Data now drives hardware innovation
Wearables that track body motion already feed streams of data to device manufacturer’s systems. New car models can “read the road” and adapt their suspension in real time. Even the simple thermostat has been upgraded to collect preferential user data. This versatile data is used in-the-moment by the driver, but also by the manufacturer in external applications like Tesla’s aggregation of every Model S driving log.
Corporate IT’s frenzy over big data
In the first phase of big data analytics, software like Hadoop capitalized with offerings to help extract knowledge from all data. Today, organizations need to refine and better understand their business and operations using existing big data. Business need to know the difference between simply defining a market segment, and knowing exactly what led an individual through to a purchase.
Time is not on your side
Data quality is inversely affected by its age. Insight gained from older data will provide you with an understanding of the past that is less relevant today. The application of these insights is also a challenge. How do you anticipate the situation that leads to a sale, an issue, or a fraud as the situation occurs? Timing is the limiting factor again, and your insights are most valuable when you can use them to create the right context at the right moment to close a sale with a potential customer.
Value from data is in real-time use
Integration technologies can make analysis more relevant by rapidly feeding fresh data from your company’s systems, user devices, mobile applications, and social networks into business intelligence and analytics environments. These technologies also enable you to transform real-time data into a series of events from which patterns can be identified as they occur.
Understand the past
Having a deeper understanding of what should have been done does not move the business forward. You need to understand what can be done now. The most successful businesses will be able to easily adopt new sources (e.g., social networks today) of information, identify new use cases or new markets before the competition, and most importantly act on this information quicker. Integration technologies ultimately provide organizations the ability to act and operate at the speed of consumers.
Anticipate the future
Real-time data integration enables you to anticipate a specific situation and to take action in the instant, while something can still be done. A business can predict the perfect moment to send a prospect an offer before she leaves the website, and they can extend the same offer in the brick and mortar store. Not only will a business know when a customer needs extra attention, but it will also have time to react and convince her to remain a loyal customer.
