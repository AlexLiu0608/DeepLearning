The “Chromebook for everyone” has run into a spot of trouble. Google and HP are recalling the microUSB charger that came with the HP Chromebook 11  after receiving nine reports of chargers overheating and melting during use.
The issue dates back to November, when Google and HP initially halted sales of the new Chromebook while it investigated complaints of overheating. The recall comes with the approval of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which has recommended that anyone who has purchased a Chromebook 11 between October 2013 and November 2013 immediately stop using the faulty charger .
Approximately 145,000 chargers are affected, and the recall includes units sold from Amazon, Best Buy, Google, and HP. If you picked up a Chromebook 11 before December 1, you can pop over to Google’s recall site to arrange getting your free replacement. In the meantime, any other microUSB charger will work just fine.
