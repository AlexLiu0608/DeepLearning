Apple wants to see its devices everywhere: in Fortune 500 companies, hospitals, even schools.  Jamf Software helps make that happen — and it just raised $30 million to keep up with Apple’s growth.
Founded by two Macintosh systems administrators, the Minneapolis, Minn.-based company hopped on the Apple train early. The company makes mobile device management software for Mac and iOS devices — but back when it started in 2002, few could have predicted Apple’s success in the business sector.
Today, Jamf manages nearly three million Apple devices for its 4,000 customers, which include 34 of the Fortune 100 as well as major school districts and government customers. The company competes with other mobile device management vendors like Microsoft System Center, MobileIron, and Airwatch, although it’s the only one focused exclusively on Apple devices.
Summit Partners led the $30 million funding round in Jamf, which values the company at more than $200 million. GSV Capital also participated in the round.
“For over 11 years, Jamf has operated as a bootstrapped startup, not relying on external resources,” said Chip Pearson, the managing partner of Jamf Software, in a statement. “Today’s announcement reflects Apple’s continued growth in the enterprise and Jamf’s commitment to helping enterprises succeed with their vision around the Apple platform.”
Jamf, which currently has around 275 employees, will use the new capital to drive product development and expand its industry partnerships, according to the company.
