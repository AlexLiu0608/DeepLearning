Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, said today that it has sold “some” display patents to Google. And while neither company released very many details, the patents sound exactly like what Google needs for Glass.
Which, of course, will compete with Foxconn partner Apple’s products.

The patent in question is for generating “a virtual image” that “is superimposed on a real-world view,” which sounds pretty much like what Google Glass does. And Foxconn is partnering with Google to set up a factory in California to manufacture Google Glass augmented reality devices.
A public launch of Google Glass is expected late this year, according to Google’s initial timetables, or early next.
“I expect Google Glass to retail for about $250 to $350,” technology expert and noted “glasshole” Robert Scoble told me last week.
Glass, which works with a paired smartphone to provide information to users right in their visual field, will compete with any wearable technology that Apple chooses to unveil, including the rumored iWatch . Apple, of course, is a key Foxconn partner, and about 60 to 70 percent of Foxconn revenue has been linked to assembling Apple’s iPhones and iPads.
But Apple’s recent sales woes have resulted in fewer orders, and Foxconn has always worked with multiple partners to diversify its income stream.
No further details were released.
