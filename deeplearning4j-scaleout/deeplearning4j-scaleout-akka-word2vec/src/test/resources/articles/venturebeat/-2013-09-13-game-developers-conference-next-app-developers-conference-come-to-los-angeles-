From the creators of the largest and longest-running game professional-focused Game Developers Conference (GDC), the brand-new Game Developers Conference Next & App Developers Conference will debut at the Los Angeles Convention Center Nov. 5-Nov. 7.
GDC Next will host presentations by leaders in the industry covering the game experiences of the future, including how we will play games, on what devices we will play them, and how we will monetize, distribute, market, and share them. Newly announced sessions include “The Next Generation of Kinect”  from Microsoft senior software engineer Claude Marais;  “Binders Full of Women: Diversifying Feminine Archetypes in Games’  by Assassin’s Creed 3 narrative director Jill Murray; and a panel discussion on  “The Evolution of eSports as a Sport, Entertainment, and International Pastime,”  including e-sports personality Marcus “DJWheat” Graham and speakers from streaming service Twitch, League of Legends developer Riot Games, and professional game organization Team Dignitas.
Also featured at GDC Next is the Next 10 game showcase, a collection of 10 exciting yet-to-debut games that have been chosen by organizers for doing something decidedly different in today’s increasingly crowded game market. The first selection in the Next 10, HumaNature Studio’s Doki-Doki Universe, has already been revealed:  “Doki-Doki Universe: Sweet, Simple and Genuine,”  by HumaNature Studios founder Greg Johnson.
ADC offers professionals a venue to share their knowledge about building, designing, marketing, and selling their apps with sessions from field experts in targeted tracks. Noteworthy talks announced include  “Evernote Case Study: Designing First Impressions that Last,”  presented by product manager Naomi Pilosof and senior product designer Kara Hodecker; Rotoshop creator Bob Sabiston in  “Programming as Art”  on different approaches to design and UI for Apple and iOS devices; and the spontaneous app critique session  “Lightning Critiques — What Makes Great Design?” , with Gravity Switch (FastWeather) cofounder Jason Mark.
