Updated at 12:30 PM PT with confirmation from Salesforce
Cloudconnect cofounder and CEO Adam Gross is back in the Salesforce family.
The CRM giant just acquired Cloudconnect, according to a brief note on Cloudconnect’s website . The terms of the deal were not disclosed (nor were any other details, really).
“We are delighted to announce that Cloudconnect is now part of Heroku, a salesforce.com company,” reads the announcement. “As part of [cloud application platform] Heroku, the Cloudconnect team will continue to pursue its mission of helping companies create great apps and experiences by connecting their customer data.”
After spending nearly seven years at Salesforce followed by a one-year stint at Dropbox, Gross cofounded Cloudconnect, which brings together CRM, social, and web data in a single database.
Salesforce is putting an increased focus on mobile development. The company just unveiled Salesforce1 , which includes a bunch of tools for mobile app developers and links with development platforms like Heroku ( acquired by Salesforce in late 2010 ). The Cloudconnect acquisition — part of a string of recent Salesforce purchases — should provide developers using Heroku’s platform-as-a-service with even more options.
A Salesforce representative confirmed the acquisition for VentureBeat, but declined to provide any addition details. Expect to hear more at Dreamforce 2013, the 11th iteration of Salesforce’s annual user and developer conference, which kicked off today and runs through Thursday.
