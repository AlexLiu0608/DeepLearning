If you’re fortunate enough to posess a computer science degree, or have picked up coding skills on your own time, you have the option to live and work virtually anywhere in the world.
But in certain cities, tech companies and well-funded startups are hiring software engineers, and there are simply not enough to meet the demand. These companies are often willing to pay sky-high salaries, typically well into the six-figures for experienced programmers.
Popular job site Indeed  has analyzed a wealth of employment data for its list of cities that are hiring computer scientists. We were surprised to see that San Francisco didn’t clinch the top spot, given that the Bay Area is widely considered the technology and innovation capital.
Our upcoming DevBeat conference , Nov. 12-Nov. 13 in San Francisco, will have a lot more on this topic. It’s a hands-on developer event packed with master classes, presentations, Q&As, and hackathons, all aimed at boosting your code skills, security knowledge, hardware hacking, and career development. Register now.
Indeed’s engineering team also analyzed computer science job postings to determine how much computer scientists are paid. These are the five most in demand jobs on Indeed (ranked in order), and their corresponding average annual salaries.
