Scheduling posts on Facebook used to be a minute-long process of pain. Today, Facebook made it a second of sweetness.
This is the old Facebook post-scheduling interface, with no fewer than five drop-down menus, the longest of which had up to 31 selectable items (day of the month) and all of which required touching, moving, and setting:
Ugly, painful, tedious, and annoying … especially if, like me, you were doing it five or six times a day as I, like the other writers at VentureBeat, scheduled posts on our most excellent Facebook page .
Today, Facebook updated its post-scheduling process and took 10-12 steps down to as few as two:
Facebook, thank goodness, has pre-populated the date field with today’s date, saving 90 percent of the pain. (If you want to do another date, Facebook now offers up a cute little calendar picker that is simple and fast.) And the time field is interestingly smart: Start typing a time, such as 4:40, and it will offer just two easily-selectable options, 4:40PM and 4:40AM.
The closest time to the current time is automatically selected, so you could be finished scheduling a post just by entering the time and clicking the Schedule button.
Thank you, Facebook! Now why couldn’t you have made this about five years ago?
