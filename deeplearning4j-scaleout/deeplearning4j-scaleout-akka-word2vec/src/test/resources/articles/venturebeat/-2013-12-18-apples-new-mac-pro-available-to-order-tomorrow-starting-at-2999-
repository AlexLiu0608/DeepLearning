Apple’s new Mac Pro may look like a trash can, but its round case houses some serious hardware. And if you’ve got the cash, it could be in your hands soon.
Apple is finally opening up orders for the new Mac Pro tomorrow, with a base model starting at $2,999. It’s Apple’s first major revision of its pro-focused computer line since the massive Power Mac G5 tower debuted in 2003 (when Apple switched to Intel processors in 2006, the Power Mac became the Mac Pro).
So what do you get for a $2,999 work horse? At a minimum, the Mac Pro comes with a quad-core Intel Xeon E5 processor (a server-class chip), which can reach speeds up to 3.9 gigahertz with Intel’s Turbo Boost technology. It also packs in dual AMD FirePro graphics cards (which Apple says equals eight times the graphics power of the last Mac Pro), 256GB of PCI-E based flash storage (which should technically be faster than typical SSD drives), and 12 gigabytes of RAM. For more serious work, you can also upgrade to an 8-core or 12-core Xeon processor.
Due to its cylindrical design, you won’t be able to easily upgrade things like the Mac Pro’s video cards. But that design also allows it to be significantly smaller than the previous Mac Pro tower. The entire thing is also cooled by a single (large) fan, which means it should be pretty quiet for such a powerhouse.
While orders are opening up tomorrow, it’s unclear when the new Mac Pro will actually start shipping to customers. We’ve contacted Apple for further details.
