DevBeat 2013 is coming up next week, and we’ve got an amazing opportunity for those of you who are a bit strapped for cash or a bit less experienced in programming.
If you register to be a volunteer for the show, you’ll automatically get free access to the amazing main stage talks, Master Classes, and more. You might be mingling with Stallman and Jeff Lawson backstage, or you could be getting our hacker attendees from Adobe and GitHub signed and sealed at the registration desk.
There are lots of opportunities to volunteer, and all of them are pretty dang fun, so please email us at briana (at) venturebeat (dot) com to apply! When you write in, also specify what day(s) and time(s) you can work; the show takes place from approximately 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on November 12-13 at San Francisco’s Regency Center.
Also, forward this to the broke devs or comp sci students in your life.
We can’t wait to see you there!
Editor’s note: Developers!
