Gesture controls are the future — whether you like them or not.
Samsung says its Smart TVs next year will come with single-finger gesture controls , which it says are a major step up from the hand-based controls we’ve seen so far.
While Samsung isn’t going into too much detail, it says its new gesture system will let users change the channel, adjust the volume, and even stop playback via an “intuitive” counterclockwise twirl of the finger.  (Let’s just hope Samsung’s gesture recognition system is precise enough to actually pick up that sort of granularity on a consistent basis.)
Of course, the big question here is whether anyone wants to control their television by pointing at it. Gesture control, like voice control, is still the type of thing that, while impressive when you’re first exposed to it, quickly becomes more of a nuisance than an exciting feature.
Or, think about it like this: If finger controls aren’t easier than pressing the buttons on a remote control, just about no one is going to bother with them after the initial novelty wears off. That’s just human nature.
In any case, let’s hope Samsung’s new system impresses.
