Yahoo has made yet another acquisition and is adding three more talented software engineers to its team.
Today, the company bought PeerCDN , according to an announcement on the startup’s website. PeerCDN is an attractive prospect for Yahoo, as its technology claims to make websites faster at lower bandwidth costs.
PeerCDN was still in private beta when it was acquired, but the team did create a video to show the technology in action. They describe it as a peer-to-peer content delivery network built with an open source project called WebRTC. The goal is to improve speeds and ensure that websites can handle an influx of high traffic.
Yahoo aims to offer rich media content, which requires ample bandwidth. The PeerCDN team will likely get to work on bolstering its communications and networking efforts.
“The team has a solid background in domain expertise and a passion for video that makes them a perfect fit for Yahoo,” a Yahoo spokesperson said in a statement to the press.
PeerCDN was founded by Stanford engineering alumni Feross Aboukhadijeh, Abi Raja, and John Hiesey, who describe themselves as “huge fans” of Javascript and open web technologies.
Under chief executive Marissa Mayer, Yahoo is building out its content strategy. The company recently hired some big names to head up its editorial team, including television journalist Katie Couric and New York Times veteran David Pogue.
Three of PeerCDN’s engineers have joined the Yahoo offices in Sunnyvale, Calif.
