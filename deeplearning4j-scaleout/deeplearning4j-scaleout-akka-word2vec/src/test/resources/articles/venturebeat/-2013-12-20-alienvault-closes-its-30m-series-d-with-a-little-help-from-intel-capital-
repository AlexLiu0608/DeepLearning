Security company AlienVault is about to get its products in front a lot more people, thanks to Intel Capital.
Intel’s investment arm announced today that it’s joined in on AlienVault’s $26.5 million series D round, which the company initially announced back in September . Intel’s contribution brings the round’s total to $30 million.
Founded in 2007, AlienVault does two things well: One, through its Open Threat Exchange Platform, it crowdsources the threat discovery and response process, connecting experts and researchers with others in the industry.
Two, with its “Unified Security Management” solution, AlienVault says it makes it easy for companies with limited security resources to monitor and respond to threats. That’s a big deal for cash-strapped startups, who often have to put security on the back-burner as they grow.
Which brings us back to Intel Capital. Alongside its contribution to the round, Intel Capital says its involvement means that it can introduce AlienVault to its network of 150,000 Intel Technology Providers. That means more customers.
AlienVault’s round was led by GGV Capital and joined by Trident Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Sigma West, and Adara Venture Partners. New investors Top Tier Capital and Correlation Ventures also participated. The company has raised $66 million to date.
