So your friends keep clogging up your Facebook feed with vague but foaming-at-the-mouth-enthusiastic rantings about Orange Is the New Black, but you can’t decide whether or not you want to commit.
What if the Internet Movie Database had a special Netflix page ranking all the TV shows the service had to offer? What if you saw that Orange Is the New Black was rated an 8.6 on a 10-point scale and was ranked number 18 out of bajillions of TV offerings? Would that help you make your decision?
Of course it would!
In addition to sorting shows by ranking, you can also sort them by sheer popularity (based on the number of votes/ratings a show has gotten from users) and freshness (i.e., release dates).
You can also check out titles ranked with MOVIEmeter, which IMDb describes as “a snapshot of what [shows] are hot based on the searches of millions of IMDb users.”
The IMDb team will try to keep this list updated, and you can make show suggestions via Facebook.
Now go enjoy that nice, boring night of pajamas, comfort food, and television, you mid-thirties working professional. You’ve earned it.
