Today wasn’t all about San Francisco and Silicon Valley — oh, no. The two biggest deals that crossed our radar were for technologies in India and space, in that order.
We also saw a flurry of activity over a Chicago startup as well.
On with the show!
Flipkart gets $360M
India is a giant country with a giant population, so it’s no surprise that it’s also the home of a giant e-commerce company backed by a giant amount of venture capital.

Dauria Aerospace closes $20M
Satellite service startup Dauria Aerospace closed a new $20 million round of funding, the company announced yesterday. Dauria aims to provide low-cost micro- and nano-satellite services to clients that seek to observe the Earth from space, thus fostering a brand-new platform of apps and services. Some of the applications would be able to do things that could impact our daily lives, such as monitoring a farm’s vegetation, tracking traffic of various transportation infrastructures, polar broadband services, and more. Essentially, we’re not really doing as much as we could with satellite technology, and Dauria wants to do something about it. Admittedly, this is less sexy than the possibility of a manned mission to Mars or colonizing the moon, but it’s still very interesting. Read the full story on VentureBeat .
