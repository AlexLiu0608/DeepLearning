As always, the closer we get to one of Apple’s iPhone media events, the better the leaks get.
Japanese site ASCII has just published a slew of photos that show the rumored gold iPhone 5S case alongside the existing black/slate and white/silver iPhone 5 colors. While unconfirmed, the pictures look convincing, with a subtle shade of gold (some are calling it “champagne”) and build quality identical to the iPhone 5′s case.
Apple is expected to hold a media event on September 10 where it will likely unveil the next iPhone. Judging from the rumors so far, we’ll see a slightly revamped “iPhone 5S” model, as well as cheaper “iPhone 5C” models with plastic cases available in multiple colors.
A gold iPhone might seem like a desperate maneuver for Apple, but as I pointed out earlier, it could really help the company in China .
