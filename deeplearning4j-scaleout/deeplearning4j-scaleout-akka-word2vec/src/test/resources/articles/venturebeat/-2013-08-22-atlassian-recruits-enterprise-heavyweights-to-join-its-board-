Australia’s Atlassian Software , a company that provides tools for software development, just recruited Facebook ‘s infrastructure expert Jay Parikh, and former Symantec  chief executive officer Enrique Salem to join its board of directors.
This is Salem’s second board appointment in recent months. He joined FireEye ‘s board shortly before the red hot security company filed for its public offering. He also serves on President Barack Obama’s management advisory board.
Speculation about Atlassian’s own IPO has been rife for years. It reached a fever pitch in 2012 when Atlassian recruited three board-members with public company experience, including the former CFO of Adobe Systems.
The Australian company has been around since 2002. It isn’t operating in the sexiest space, but it has been growing like gangbusters — it boasts over 500 employees, and its software is used by 25,000 customers.

Atlassian offers a suite of software products — its best known is collaboration toolset  Confluence , which is used by technology giants like Facebook  and Hubspot .
According to Atlassian president Jay Simons, the company has had the “luxury of handpicking” its board, given that it’s been profitable since the early days.
“Our latest two members augment a pretty enviable board,” Simons told VentureBeat. “From the start, we’ve built [our board] for the long term — we’re building a company that will be here 50 years from now.
Simons said that Atlassian will benefit from having Salem on the board, as he knows “how to grow a company, how to prioritize, how to recruit and retain talent, and how to scale a corporate culture.” Meanwhile, Parikh will help Atlassian scale its platform and engineering practices.
In a rare feat for a software startup, Atlassian has only taken one round of venture funding, $60 million from Accel in 2010.
