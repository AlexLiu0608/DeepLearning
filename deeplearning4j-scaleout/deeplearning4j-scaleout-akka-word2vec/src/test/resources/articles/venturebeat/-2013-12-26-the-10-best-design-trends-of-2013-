This year renewed our hope in the future of web and mobile design. A handful of services, apps, individuals, and trends showed us a more beautiful, elegant digital world than we’ve ever seen before, and we’re actually looking forward to highlighting them.
Last year was  completely mixed , full of good (grid layouts), bad (cartoony mascots), and downright indefensible (unnecessary navigational bullcrap).
This year, while we’re totally barfing over a small group of standout horror shows, we’re largely impressed. Designers took the best of last year’s trends — full-bleed images, truly excellent typography , magazine-worthy interfaces — and extrapolated them to new heights.
Oh, yeah — speaking of typography, don’t miss our annual post on the best typefaces of the year .
Behold! The very best design trends of 2013:
Flatness
Thank the gods skeuomorphism is finally, thoroughly dead. That wrinkled carcass was on life support last year. Someone, somewhere finally pulled the plug, paving the way for well-designed interfaces featuring shapes, colors, blend modes, and every kind of non-wood-grain effect imaginable.
Gone are the fake-shiny overlays of yesteryear! Gone are the hokey “stitched leather” frames, the linen-textured menus, the ruled freaking paper backgrounds, the letterpress-ish drop shadows.
Now, we got us some flat design. It’s everywhere. It’s nice that iOS 7 rode that train into town, but the train started out long before Jony Ive unveiled his own take on the trend.
Here are a few of our favorite flatness implementations:
