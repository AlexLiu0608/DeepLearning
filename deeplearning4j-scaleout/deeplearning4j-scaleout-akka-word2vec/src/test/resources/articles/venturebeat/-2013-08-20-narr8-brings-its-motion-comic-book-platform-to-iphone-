Digital comic book startup Narr8 is rolling out a new version of its storytelling platform for the iPhone today, the company revealed to VentureBeat.
The service lets users both read and create motion comics for free . Narr8 isn’t what most U.S. comic book fans would think of as comics, but it definitely has some leeway since we’re dealing with a digital storytelling platform (meaning it’ll be a little bit new to everyone). Essentially, you’re still downloading digital comics that can be read on a weekly or monthly basis, but Narr8′s approach is set up a lot like mobile gaming networks in the sense that it uses gamification techniques as a main part of its business strategy.
The new Narr8 iPhone app translates its motion comic book experience to a smaller screen, which is important considering that the size of a device can have a huge impact on a story. Narr8 said all of its previously created series will be available on the iPhone, including its educational non-fiction line of stories, including  Alma Mater , Micro , Biographics , and Eureka .
Founded in 2011, the Moscow, Russia-based startup has over 700,000 users and content that’s available in four different languages. Narr8 has $4 million in funding from IMI.VC Venture Company. In addition to the iPhone app, Narr8 is available on Android, Kindle Fire, and the iPad.
