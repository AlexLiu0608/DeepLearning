Don’t forget to buy your tickets for the 7th Annual Crunchies Awards , which celebrate innovation, entrepreneurship, and the most promising tech startups.
Buy your Crunchies tickets  through Eventbrite and get ready for a star-studded, glamorous evening in San Francisco’s Davies Symphony Hall on Monday, February 10, 2014.
This is the 7th year that VentureBeat has co-hosted these awards, along with  GigaOm  and  TechCrunch . Over the years, the awards have grown to attract thousands of nominations and hundreds of attendees each year. It’s a chance for us to celebrate and honor the best the tech industry has to offer. We will announce winners from 20 different award categories live on stage at the event beginning at 7:30pm.
Following the awards, the Davies will also provide a festive playground for this year’s after party. As always, there will be a hosted bar, hors d’oeuvres, intriguing interactive entertainment and other fun surprises. And tech bloggers in black tie, natch.
General admission  tickets are now available and start at $80 . Seating is very limited and the event tends to sell out quickly.
We hope to see you in San Francisco!
