Genophen wants to tell you what diseases you might get before you ever get them.
Today it received $2 million in its third round of funding, according to a filing with Securities and Exchange Commission .
The company creates software that can look at a range of details within your lifestyle and genetics that may predispose you to certain diseases and sicknesses. These are medical, behavioral, and environmental factors that you input into Genophen’s system. It then “assesses your risk” and provides you with what is inevitably a frightening list of illnesses you might be headed toward.
But it’s not just a fear mongering service. The technology focuses on preventative healthcare by suggesting a number of actions you can take to stop these issues from ever coming to a head.
It isn’t fully intended for the consumer, however, but rather to be used as a “clinical support tool,” for doctors to use and help walk you through.
“The platform drives better medical-decision making through physician expertise, clinical knowledge, genome interpretation, and health analytics,” the company explains on its website.
If you don’t have a primary care physician, Genophen will give you access to its network of doctors to help you find one and direct you to the necessary labwork you’ll need to give to your doctor for the program.
Genophen was founded in 2008 at Stanford and got its first round of funding in 2011 after relocating to Los Altos, Calif. It received its second round of funding in 2012. Investors listed on the filing include Babak Yazdani, and Farzad Naimi.
