Leap Motion, watch out.
An Oslo, Norway-based startup, Elliptic Labs, has launched a software development kit and hardware proof-of-concept of a new way of controlling your smartphone or tablet — with simple touchless gestures. The company says it has major Asian smartphone manufacturers onboard for shipping products next year, is demoing the product at CEATEC in Tokyo today, and is already playing Fruit Ninja and Subway Surfer on an Android phone as if it was an Xbox Kinect game.
The technology, Elliptic says, was inspired by nature — by bats, in fact.
“We came out of university with an idea that it was possible to create a user interface technology using ultrasound, just like a bat navigates in the darkness,” cofounder Haakon Bryhni told me yesterday.
The touchless gesturing works via a dedicated ultrasound transmitter that continuously sends inaudible signals from your phone. When some of them bounce back because your hand is gesturing near your phone, a sensor picks that up and interprets the motion and then tells your smartphone what to do. In a shipping device, the technology would be entirely “stealth-mounted,” hidden from view.

Elliptic Labs’ ultrasound chip is just 3mm square.
“We have a 180-degree sphere of sensitivity up to half a meter away from the phone,” Bryhni says. “You can read a newsmagazine, just very casually moving your hand to change the page, you can switch applications, change tabs, adjust sliders, close tabs, switch channels, play games … anything you can do on a smartphone you can do with your hands.”
Perhaps not exactly anything.
I asked, for instance, if Elliptic Labs’ technology would enable a sort of air keyboard, helping you to type quicker on a small mobile device. The company investigated that possibility, and apparently it’s possible but not user-friendly. It’s challenging for people to hit the exact right spots. Games like Fruit Ninja, which requires general swipes that mimics sword slashes, work incredibly well.
The device, which is just 3mm square and can be hidden in a smartphone, is incredibly sensitive:
“We can do millimeter accuracy,” Bryhni says. “If you move your hand just one millimeter we can detect it, and the device has very short latency — shorter latency than a touchscreen in fact.”
The real question, of course, is when this technology will ship.
