The human body is a glorious thing. Or at least it can be.
Gain Fitness has raised $2.14 million to make your body even more glorious using its library of fitness apps. Founder and CEO Nick Gammell also told VentureBeat that Gain’s app surpassed 1 million downloads and the company has some interesting new products and partnerships in the works.
“I wanted to build technology that takes away pen-and-paper aspect of planning a fitness routine ,” Gammell said, in a live demo of the app earlier this year. “I wanted a fitness routine customized to my real time situation that considered what I did two days ago, what my overall goal is, and what I like to do. You can get a super efficient workout in a short period of time, as long as you know what to do.”
Gain powers a “digital trainer store” that provides professionally-designed, customizable workouts to people exercising at home.
It offers a range of separate workout packs for weight training, pilates, basketball, yoga and more. The most recent additions are a cross fit app, and rehabilitation programs for your back, hip, knee, shoulder, and hip pain. Gain hopes to release a pre-natal pilates app on the App Store next week.
The apps collect data on your fitness level, goals, time constraints, and matches workouts accordingly. People can mix and match workout packs and exercises to create customs workouts and set up fitness plans.
The app gives audio cues to guide you through every set and rep, as well as motivational messages. All the data is tracked so you can monitor your progress over time.
Gammell previously worked as a management consultant for Deloitte. He was a trip-sport athlete growing up and grew frustrated with how hard it was to maintain a regular workout schedule while on the road.
He describes himself as “data-obsessed,” and said that while plenty of fitness programs out there claim to be the end-all-be-all of workout regimens, the important thing is to understand your own body, your goals, and tailor a regimen to your lifestyle.
This isn’t something that people without extensive knowledge of fitness science can do, however, so Gain aims to do it for them.
Its closest competition are apps like iPersonalTrainer and Skimble, but there are dozens of other fitness apps out there to track your physical activity, teach you dance moves, and even connect you to a trainer via live video feeds.
Gammell said that the $2.14 million listed on the SEC filing represents convertible seed notes being converted into equity. The company is looking to bring another investor onboard to hire more people and put more money into marketing efforts.
He also hinted at some significant impending partnerships with big gym chains, but those details are still under wraps.
Gain is based in San Francisco.
