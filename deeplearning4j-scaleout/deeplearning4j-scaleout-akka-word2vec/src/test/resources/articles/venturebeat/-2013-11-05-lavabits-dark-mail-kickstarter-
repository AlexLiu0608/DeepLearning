If you’ve been complaining about the lack of privacy in your email, now’s the time to put your money where your mouth is.
The Dark Alliance has put up a Kickstarter for its project Dark Mail, an open-source secure email product that ensures you are the only person to hold your encryption keys. The Alliance is a group of people that include defunct secure email client Lavabit founder Ladar Levison and executives from private messaging app Silent Circle.
Dark Mail itself is an extension of Levison’s Lavabit, which he shut down when the government came knockin’ for the company’s data. The email service was believed to be the same former NSA contractor Edward Snowden used. Levison shut down the service, saying it was between getting rid of nearly ten years of work and being “ complicit in crimes against the American people .”
If the funding goals are met, Levison will work with developers to clean up Lavabit’s source code and publish it for anyone to use.
The group is looking to raise exactly $196,608 for the project, and has already raised $27,706 from 821 backers. It has only been open a day and will run through Wednesday, November 27.
It will also build out the “Dark Mail protocol” that will the group says will give the user, “the security of PGP without the cognitive burden; if someone can use email today they will be able to use Dark Mail tomorrow.”
