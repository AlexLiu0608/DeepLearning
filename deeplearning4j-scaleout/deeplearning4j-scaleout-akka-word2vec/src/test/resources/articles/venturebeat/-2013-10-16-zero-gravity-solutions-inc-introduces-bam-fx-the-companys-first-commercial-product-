Technology Developed for Use in Space, Now Applied to Agriculture Here       on Earth
BOCA RATON, Fla.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 16, 2013–
Zero       Gravity Solutions, Inc. (ZGSI or “the Company”), (Pink Sheets:       ZGSI), announced today the introduction of BAM-FX™, a proprietary       technology designed for use in the space program, which we are now       developing and preparing to deploy for agricultural use on Earth to create densely nutritious, immune system enhancing food for application       to world agriculture. Initial data utilizing our technology as applied       to agricultural use on Earth has demonstrated, through independent       certified laboratory analysis, the ability to systemically deliver       targeted minerals and micronutrients throughout a plant from seed or       root to maturity. This was accomplished without the use of genetic       modification or traditional fertilizers. The ability to create highly       nutritious, immune system enhanced crops that are not Genetically       Modified Organisms (GMO) is a potentially significant, disruptive       agricultural technology.
Harvey Kaye, chairman of the Company, stated, “Our six years of work on       the International Space Station and the intellectual property we own has       allowed us to introduce the first of an anticipated pipeline of       technologies to help to feed the world.” Mr. Kaye further stated, “The       commercial deployment of BAM-FX creates an executable path to revenue in       the near term.”
Richard Godwin, the Company’s chief executive officer and president,       stated, “During the next 12 months, the Company will be engaged in       rigorous field testing in conjunction with end product users,       foundations, governmental agencies and academia.” Mr. Godwin further       added, “It is expected that peer-reviewed data resulting from this work       will lead to final formulations, application methodologies,       manufacturing, sales and distribution of this breakthrough technology.”
