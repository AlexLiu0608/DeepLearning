iOS 7 is probably the biggest change to Apple’s mobile operating system since the move from the first iPhone to the iPhone 3G with its newfangled app store. As such, developers are wondering how to update their apps , how to use it to the fullest, and how to ensure their existing apps don’t crash on iPhone owners’ fancy new iPhone 5S and 5C’s.
So Apple’s helping them out:
Get in-depth guidance about developing for iOS 7, learn practical coding tips and tricks, and obtain valuable one-on-one programming and design assistance in our lab. Choose which day is best for you — app developer day or game developer day.
The sessions are available in San Francisco, New York, Tokyo, Shanghai, Berlin, and London and are divided into app developer sessions and game developer sessions.
App developer sessions will focus on user interface design, app architecture, integrating iOS 7 technologies such as background downloading, silent push notifications, and iBeacon, as well as security and privacy in iOS 7.
Editor’s note: Developers! If you’re good and want to be great, our upcoming DevBeat conference , Nov. 12-Nov. 13 in San Francisco, is a hands-on event packed with master classes, presentations, Q&As, and hackathons, all aimed at boosting your code skills, security knowledge, hardware hacking, and career development. Register now.
Game developers, on the other hand, will focus on OpenGL ES 3.0 and the massive power of Apple’s new 64-bit A7 CPU as well as how to create 2D games with Sprite Kit, how to integrate with Game Center, and a primer on app store distribution and marketing.
Something that will be appealing to all will be this small segment:
“Gain a better understanding of how apps get selected and featured on the App Store and key best practices for getting your app to a larger international audience.”
Every developer wants that.
With the release of the new iPhone 5S , the new iPhone 5C , and of course the broad launch of the new operating system, more than 200 million people are now using iOS 7 . This sounds like a good way of learning how to better meet them where they are.
VentureBeat is creating an index of the most exciting cloud-based services for developers . Take a look at our initial suggestions and  complete the survey  to help us build a definitive index. We’ll publish the official index later this month, and for those who fill out surveys, we’ll send you an expanded report free of charge.  Speak with the analyst who put this survey together to get more in-depth information,  inquire within .
