Apple CEO Tim Cook announced this morning that two thirds of iPhones are running iOS 7 already. At least I think he did.
Actually what he said, precisely, was this:
“Nearly two-thirds of the devices are running iOS 7.”
I assume that means iPhones and iPads, but it was unclear from Cook’s wording, which I assume was a bit of a mistake, if he means recent iPhones and iPads. Because, of course, not all iPhones are capable of running iOS 7. iOS 7 is the biggest change to iOS since the first iPhone, Cook also said, and within five days of its launch, 200 million devices were running the new operating system. Interestingly, although that’s fast, it’s not as fast as iOS 6 .
Either way you slice it, it’s the fastest large upgrade cycle in history. Yes, faster than Android, which is much more fragmented due to the many more players in its device and software ecosystem.
“It blows away the other guys,” Cook said, referencing Google.
Apple also sold nine million iPhones in the first weekend of sales, Cook said. ”When we see customer response like this, it makes all the hard work worthwhile.”
