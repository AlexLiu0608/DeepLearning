Feedly , one of the best alternatives to the now-defunct Google Reader, launched a better-featured Pro version of its service a few weeks ago. But it was only available at that time for 5,000 users.
Now the Pro version is fully available to anyone who wants to give it a shot for $5 a month or $45 a year.
Those who used Google Reader will likely enjoy the features found in Pro, including article search, one-click Evernote integration, one-click Pocket integration, and improved customer support.
Some users weren’t happy that Feedly is charging for search (one of the most important features for an RSS reader) because search was free in Google Reader. They also weren’t happy that users would have to pay for HTTPS support.
Feedly has decided to make HTTPS support available for free to everyone, but search still will cost you. Feedly says it is important for it to offer a better -featured version of its product since the move will help the company sustain itself.
“This is an important milestone for feedly because a more sustainable company will lead to more innovation for users of both feedly pro and feedly standard,” the company wrote in a blog post today. “The goal is to offer our most passionate users more productivity and make feedly sustainable in the long run.”
Basically, if search is so important to your RSS experience, suck it up and pay for it, folks.
