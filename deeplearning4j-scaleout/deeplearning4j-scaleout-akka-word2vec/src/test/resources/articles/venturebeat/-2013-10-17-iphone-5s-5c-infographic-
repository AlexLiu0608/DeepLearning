Sometimes you just have to sleep on the street for two weeks to get a new iPhone.
At least, that’s what one 19-year-old, Brian, and a number of other people did in September ahead of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C launches.
Protect Your Bubble , a company that offers insurance on cell phones and other items, surveyed over 1,200 people waiting in line on release day outside New York’s 5th Avenue Apple store. It wanted to find out just what kind of crazy people were waiting for so long and what they really wanted from Apple.
For these folks, it was all about the iPhone 5S . Only 17 percent of folks waiting that day were interested in the new candy-colored cheaper iPhone. They wanted the fingerprint ID and the new A7 chip the most.
And these people are truly obsessed with the product. Sixty-six percent of people were trading up from a previous iPhone model and if forced, 52 percent say they would rather eat the same meal every single day for a year than give up their phone.
Of course, despite all this and the hundreds of dollars they spend on the little communications device, fewer than half had plans to buy any kind of insurance.
