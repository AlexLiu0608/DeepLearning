Alchemist Accelerator is an accelerator program that specializes in helping startups make money. The entrepreneurs are expected to build sustainable, revenue-generating businesses, even in the nascent stages.
Ravi Belani, managing director at Alchemist Accelerator
Alchemist only selects startups that are focused on selling to businesses, rather than consumers. That’s what differentiates the program from Y Combinator, TechStars and the rest, according to founder Ravi Belani. Belani is a faculty-member at Stanford University, and is also well-connected with investors from the top venture firms.
VentureBeat reported on Alchemist  shortly after its launch. Since then, the program has already enrolled four classes of business to business (B2B) startups, with the latest launching at demo day today. The startups receive $30,000 in initial funding, which is a larger sum that Y Combinator startups.
Alchemist aims to provide seed funding to about 48 startups each year. After that, the startups are typically in a strong position for a first round of financing. Already, venture firms like  Andreessen Horowitz ,  Citrix’s Accelerator ,  True Ventures ,  Greylock Partners , and  Founders Fund  have invested in the Alchemist startups.
“Alchemist is slowly but surely becoming an institution of its own in Silicon Valley,” said Deepak Jeevan Kumar, an investor at General Catalyst, who attended demo day. Kumar told me he was particularly impressed with Airpost, one of the eight startups that presented today.
The program continues to attract talent, especially among entrepreneurs who want to make money — as well as disrupt, innovate, and all the rest.

Enterprise-focused startups continue to perform well in both the public and private markets. In the tech sector, the majority of the companies that filed for an initial public offering this year were enterprise-focused, a trend that is set to continue .
CRM tool SocialPandas graduated from Alchemist, and went on to raise $1.5 million
The current class has been working on products for six months (longer than the majority of accelerator programs), and have received introductions to dozens of potential customers and advisors. They all have functional websites, and are testing their products in the market. The technology ranges from customer relationship management (CRM) to 3D printing.
