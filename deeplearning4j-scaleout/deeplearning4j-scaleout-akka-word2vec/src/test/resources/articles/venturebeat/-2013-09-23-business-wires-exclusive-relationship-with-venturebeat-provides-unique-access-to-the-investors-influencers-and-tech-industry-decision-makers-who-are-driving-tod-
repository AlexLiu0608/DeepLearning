Business Wire today announced it has entered into an exclusive       agreement with  VentureBeat — the web’s leading news service focusing on the intersection of       technology, people and money — to provide innovative companies       worldwide with direct access to the digital decision-makers, tech       industry influencers and venture capital/private equity investors who       collectively are transforming the global economy.
Business Wire members seeking high-profile visibility for their new       product or service, or to generate possible investment interest, will       have a unique opportunity to reach these key audiences via  Business       Wire’s exclusive collaboration with VentureBeat . Business Wire       releases will be promoted to VentureBeat’s millions of readers, featured       on its main editorial presentation channel, and archived permanently on       the VentureBeat site for future reference.
Since 2006, VentureBeat has emerged as the go-to resource in the VC and       tech communities for its enterprising coverage of the dynamic people and       disruptive technologies that are radically reshaping our lives. Its       aggressive, well-reported coverage of technology startups has earned       VentureBeat a reputation of editorial excellence among its large and       dedicated following of 5.5 million unique monthly users, along with       nearly a half-million friends and followers via Facebook and Twitter . More       important than sheer numbers, however, is its desirable demographic       audience, consisting of senior-level business executives, technology       strategists, venture capitalists, investors, and consumer enthusiasts       who turn to VentureBeat as their daily, first-read for technology news       and analysis.
“In many ways, this relationship returns Business Wire to its roots,”       noted Cathy       Baron Tamraz , Business Wire’s chief executive officer. “As an       aggressive San Francisco start-up itself in 1961, Business Wire       has historically enjoyed a special relationship with technology       start-ups and entrepreneurs. We worked closely with many of Silicon       Valley’s pioneering start-ups; our growth mirrored theirs as we evolved       into global enterprises.
“Through its agreement with VentureBeat, Business Wire looks forward       to linking the imaginative ideas of today’s generation of innovators to       the key audiences they are hoping to reach — just as it has done for       thousands of companies trying to get noticed by industry influencers and       investors since 1961,” Tamraz added.
“Business Wire is an excellent platform for us,” said Matt Marshall,       Founder and Editor-in-Chief, VentureBeat. “As a trusted news       distributor, Business Wire gives us access to a robust new audience who       will be informed and inspired by our content.”
