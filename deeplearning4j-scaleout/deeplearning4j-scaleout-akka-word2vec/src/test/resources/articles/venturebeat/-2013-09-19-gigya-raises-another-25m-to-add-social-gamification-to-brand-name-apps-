Social engagement service Gigya closed a new $25 million round of funding, the startup announced today.
Gigya attempts to make websites, services, and applications more engaging through the use of social gaming mechanics. To do this, it uses plugins that are easy to integrate. Clients that use Gigya are also able to use the social data it collects and feed it into marketing automation systems like HubSpot, Marketo, and others.
The startup said it plans to use the new capital to scale its service to more platforms, increase its client base, and hire additional employees. Gigya currently has over 200 employees and about 700 customers, including WWE, Art.com, AARP, The Atlantic, and others.
Founded in 2006, the Mountain View, Calif.-based startup has raised a total of $70 million in funding to date, from Mayfield Fund, Benchmark Capital, DAG Ventures, Advanced Publications, and Adobe. The new round of funding was led by Greenspring Ventures, with participation from existing investors.
