In the tech world, terms and acronyms constantly gain buzz and lose popularity. But how do you choose the right one and identify which terms have lost favor?
Recently, the term service-oriented architecture (SOA) has fallen off the radar. It’s seen less in Linkedin profiles and resumes, and some vendors have even dropped it from their product names. This surely doesn’t mean people are integrating various apps less, especially with the use of software-as-a-service (SaaS) apps rising exponentially. With SaaS, social integration, and the proliferation of mobile apps, businesses are integrating more than ever. So, why the shift in terms?
Survival of the fittest
Market demands have shifted focus to services rather than on architectures itself. The traditional SOA approach is not as relevant to new business paradigms, like an agile workforce, willingness to pivot, and flexible infrastructures, which are increasingly reliant on cloud and SaaS. Cloud and SaaS apps are attractive for enterprises not only because they can be subscribed to in minutes but also because their simple interfaces makes them very easy to integrate with new channels, like social and mobile. Similarly, the rise of sensors and portable devices isn’t only the result of a ubiquitous network. It’s also because of the ease of exposing them as a service and gaining access to their data. With this new focus comes new terminology as people want to discuss “apps” and app integration, not seemingly archaic SOA.
Core principles never go away. They evolve
Don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. The main goal of SOA has always been to align IT with business to turn services into business assets, which is also the main goal of app integration. The capability to onboard new business functionalities from anywhere and combine them with in-house applications provides for a better customer experience. It’s also core to transforming your business with the capability to propose differentiating net-new services.
You can teach an old dog new tricks. Just rename the dog
We are no longer service-oriented; rather, we help deliver services. As services are now dealing with the customer directly, they must perform extremely well and consistently. Thousands or millions of simultaneous service users cannot have an impact on any single customer’s performance.
Whether we call it SOA or not, the need to integrate has never been more necessary for any sized business. Find out if your current strategy lines up with industry best practices with a free, online assessment .
