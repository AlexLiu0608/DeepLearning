After months of false hope and speculation, the BBC recently announced that it had recovered a number of old episodes from its classic sci-fi series Doctor Who, which it is now making available for sale exclusively on iTunes today.
For those of you living underneath a cultural rock, Doctor Who is a brilliant British TV show about a human-looking alien named The Doctor that travels through space and time in a little blue police box with a handful of companions. It’s the longest running television program,  spanning all the way back to the ’60s . During that period, the BBC decided to write over old recording of its programs to save money since it was a pre-VCR/DVR era. The episodes released today were previously thought to be lost for that reason.
There are 11 total episodes in the collection or two serials (aka mini-series) The Enemy of the World and The Web of Fear, which feature Patrick Troughton as The Doctor from way back in 1967-1968. All episodes have been remastered, and each serial is priced at $10.
Part of me does wish the BBC had made these episodes available in other media stores, or perhaps even allowed me to buy and download them to play on non-Apple devices. However, I’m sure that option will become available at some point in the future.
The BBC released a preview clip of the remastered episodes via YouTube, which we’ve embedded below because it’s Friday and Doctor Who is awesome.
