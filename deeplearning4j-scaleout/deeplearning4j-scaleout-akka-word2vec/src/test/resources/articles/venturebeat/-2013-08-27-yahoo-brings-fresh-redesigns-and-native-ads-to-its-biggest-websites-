Under Marissa Mayer, Yahoo has made a concerted effort not only to update its image, but also to completely reinvigorate all of its products.
We’re now seeing that effort extend to more of the company’s websites.  Yahoo announced today that it’s redesigned  big sites like  Yahoo! Sports ,   Yahoo! Movies  and   Yahoo! Weather , to look just like the (generally) busy Yahoo! News and Yahoo! homepage. For most of the sites, this means a large marquee at the top and a row of stories underneath. The design is nothing too special, but Yahoo’s clearly owning it.
Of course, no redesign is complete without space for advertising. Alongside the new pages, Yahoo is also extending advertiser access to Stream Ads, the  mobile-friendly “native” advertising format it introduced earlier this year .  Via the billboard ad format brands can extend the capability of their ads by say letting users buy movie tickets with the ads themselves. 
“At Yahoo!, we believe that advertising can and should be as entertaining as the surrounding media content itself,” the company says.
