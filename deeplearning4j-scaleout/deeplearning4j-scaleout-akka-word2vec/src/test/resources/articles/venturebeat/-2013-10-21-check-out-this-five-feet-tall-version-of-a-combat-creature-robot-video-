Combat Creatures  are little, spider-like robots with six legs. The first versions of these robots are known as Attacknids, and they can fight each other, firing projectiles with a range of 30 feet. If you can knock the shields off the legs of your opponent, you score points.
While the little robots are cool, this giant version is something to behold. Wow! Stuff, showed off a 5-foot-tall version of its Stryder robot last week at the Pepcom holiday gift event in San Francisco. The one-of-a-kind giant Stryder shook the ground when it walked, and it fired a giant foam missile at a human dummy target.
These Attacknids, an invention of Jamie Mantzel and developed over the past eight years, are the first in a line of fighting robots called Combat Creatures. The smaller ones are now out in stores. Each comes with Bolt ‘N’ Battle Combat Armor that flies off when hit by something. You can stage a battle between robots until only one’s left standing. The Attacknids cost $80, and an app-based Attacknid that you can control with a smartphone is available for $130 exclusively at Brookstone.
The weapon projectiles include the Snyper Dart, Destroyer Spheres, and Dissector Discs. You can control up to 40 robots at a time using a wireless remote control handset with 2.4 gigahertz wireless technology.
Check out our video of the giant Stryder in action. It’s a little scary.
