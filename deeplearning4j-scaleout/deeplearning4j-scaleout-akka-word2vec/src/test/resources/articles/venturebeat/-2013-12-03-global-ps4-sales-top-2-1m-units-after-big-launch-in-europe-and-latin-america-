PlayStation 4 global sales have topped 2.1 million units as Sony’s next-generation video game console is now available in 32 countries.
The Japanese company debuted the PS4 in the U.S. and Canada on Nov. 15. It moved into Europe, Australasia, and Latin America on Nov. 29, where it sold through more than 700,000 units. The numbers show that Sony has allocated its available launch units across the globe in the hope of raising demand on a worldwide basis. That could be why there are shortages of the console in North America.
But the numbers, which are current for sell-through data through Dec. 1, also show that supplies of the console are much more plentiful than in past generations. In years past, a console maker would sell a million units in a weekend and then make gamers wait for weeks for new shipments. But this launch suggests there are a lot of units available and more coming. That’s consistent with Nintendo’s launch a year ago of the Wii U game console, and it also reflects how robust the global supply chain has become.
It’s also happening at a time when Microsoft has launched the Xbox One game console, which hit the market in North America on Nov. 22. Both Sony and Microsoft said they sold a million units to gamers in the first 24 hours of their respective launch days.
“PS4 delivered the best launch in PlayStation history with the North American release, and we’ve continued this incredibly successful start in Europe, Australasia, and Latin America,” said Andrew House, the president and group CEO at Sony Computer Entertainment, in a statement. “Demand remains incredibly strong and continues to overwhelm the supply worldwide, but we are diligently working to meet those growing demands and to deliver additional PS4 units to our retail partners throughout the holiday season. We are extremely grateful for the passion of PlayStation fans and thank them for their continued support.”
Sony says gamers are using the new “share” button on the DualShock 4 wireless controller, with more than 6.5 million shares to date. Sony also confirmed that its cloud-gaming services, based on Gaikai’s cloud technology, will launch in the U.S. in 2014.
