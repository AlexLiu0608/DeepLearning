It’s not iOS 7′s radical new design that’s causing the most issues for consumers — it’s Apple’s iMessage.
A bug in the new operating system has been wreaking havoc on Apple’s messaging service, with issues like messages being sent to incorrect contacts, and messages mistakenly being shown as delivered when they’re actually unsent. Last night, Apple finally acknowledged the trouble.
“We are aware of an issue that affects a fraction of a percent of our iMessage users, and we will have a fix available in an upcoming software update,” Apple said in a statement to the Wall Street Journal . “In the meantime, we encourage any users having problems to reference our troubleshooting documents or contact AppleCare to help resolve their issue. We apologize for any inconvenience this causes impacted users.”
iMessage lets iOS and Mac users send free text chats to each other, and it converts those chats into texts for users on other mobile devices. While you wait for Apple’s official fix, you can try restarting your device, or you can also disable iMessage, reset your network settings, and then re-enable iMessage, the WSJ notes.
