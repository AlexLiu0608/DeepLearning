In 2011, a group of technology companies that included  Apple , Microsoft, Sony , and BlackBerry banded together to outbid Google on a bundle of patents from Nortel Networks. This cadre was victorious, paying $4.5 billion for around 4,000 patents , which Google couldn’t match.
Now the group, which calls itself the Rockstar Consortium, is reportedly looking to offload some of those patents.
But the consortium has had a tough time finding buyers, according to Bloomberg . It’s a stark contrast to 2011′s fervent bidding war, which placed a huge value on the patents, most of which relate to wireless technologies.
Rockstar has already starting selling off a few patents — and we do mean just a few. In July, the consortium  announced a sale of seven mobile communications patents to intellectual property company Spherix, for which it received $1 million in stock, an undisclosed amount of cash, and (eventually) a percentage of future profits.
The Ottawa-based Rockstar hasn’t had much success licensing the patents, which is why it’s looking to sell a portion of them. In October, Rockstar filed suit against Google, Samsung , HTC, and others for patent infringement. The patents involved in the litigation are not up for sale, said Bloomberg.
Rockstar’s patents cover technology related to 4G LTE wireless capabilities, Wi-Fi, semiconductors, and data networking, among other categories.
The consortium has not responded to a request for comment by press time. We’ll update this article if we hear back later.
