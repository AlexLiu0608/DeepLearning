Vine has fixed some of its fundamental problems, which users have been complaining about since the beginning.
You can now maintain multiple posts in progress over time and remove, reorganize, and replace any shot within a post before you share them.
“Vine was built for one purpose: to make it easy for people to capture life in motion and share it with the world,” Vine’s iOS director Ben Sheats said in a blog post. “That is the reason we built the Vine camera, and it’s why we continue to improve upon and build new tools for your creations, nurturing the balance between power and simplicity that you’ve come to expect from us. We think these features offer new ways for people to express themselves and their creativity.”
Vine lets you create and share a looping 6-second video. The Twitter-owned app has 40 million registered users, which is significantly up from the 13 million it announced in early June.
Despite its impressive popularity and growth, users still had some complaints, which became even more pronounced with the release of competitors like Instagram video and Cameo .
Vine users had to finish their video posts all at once, rather than taking small clips over a period of time. This meant if your phone crashed or got lost, you lost a post. It was also somewhat limiting to your bite-sized video expression.
Sometimes art can’t be made in one go.
Now you can save any post and come back to it later, saving up to ten posts at once.
Users also weren’t able to edit the timeline of their clips before — they were stuck with whatever order they shot. Now they can tap an edit button in the app and move clips around to their hearts’ content.
Vine debuted in January and immediately caused quite the sensation amongst the social-media obsessed. I distinctly remember being at a party where Vine videos were made of piñata smashing, the blowing out of birthday candles, and someone doing an Irish jig. It was a fun party, although truthfully might have been more fun if people put their phones away.
People just love to take short, quick, funny videos and share them, and the competition is getting fiercer. As mentioned above, Instagram, which lets you shoot 15-second videos, has a massive following, and some prefer it over Vine.
Cameo wants to help users go beyond repeating clips of cat yawns and inspire filmmakers. who can turn their clips into two-minute short films, complete with color filters and a soundtrack.
In the meantime, existing Vine users can be satisfied that their complaints were heard.
Meme away, readers, meme away.
