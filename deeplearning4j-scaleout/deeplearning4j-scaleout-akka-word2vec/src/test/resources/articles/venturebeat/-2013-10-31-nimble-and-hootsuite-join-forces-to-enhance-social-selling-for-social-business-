New Nimble Contacts App for HootSuite Enables Business Teams to       Intelligently Engage Prospects and Customers Effectively on Social Media
SANTA MONICA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 31, 2013–
Today, Nimble , the pioneering       Social Relationship Platform, released the Nimble Contacts App for       HootSuite, the leading social media management platform. The new App       enables users of both Nimble and HootSuite to better surface rich       information about contacts and prospects, in order to leverage social       selling.
“The face of social selling is changing rapidly — a significant       expansion from selling via traditional methods,” says Barbara Giamanco,       author of The New Handshake: Sales Meets Social Media. “Using the       Nimble Contacts App in HootSuite creates a new and powerful customer       engagement workflow for those who have embraced the social selling       model.”
Completing the Loop
From inside the main HootSuite screen, users can see and act on any of       their contacts using their Nimble account. As they use HootSuite to       monitor and build their social media presence, establish credibility,       and communicate, now they can take any actions they would normally do in       Nimble, without leaving HootSuite. For example, users can:
Check on any of their contacts’ social networks and reach out on other         channels
See how they and their team are connected to anyone in their network
View a complete communications history with that contact, regardless         of channel
Assign a tag to segment contacts
Use Nimble’s Mark as Important star system — timely messages stay         front and center
Set a schedule with the Stay in Touch reminder system; if users fall         out of touch, Nimble will remind them
Add and Assign Activities to themselves and their members
Add Task reminders for future actions they need to remember
Add, edit, or update their Nimble contact records.
“We’ve significantly upgraded the Nimble Contacts App for HootSuite in       order to give sales, marketing and business development professionals       exactly what they need to prospect, find, nurture and cultivate       effective relationships,” said Nimble CEO Jon Ferrara. “Nimble’s quick       and powerful insights immediately help you build better relationships.”
Better Relationships. Better Results.
Using Nimble and HootSuite in a complementary way creates a “righteous       cycle” of monitoring, listening to, engaging with, and organizing your       most important relationships. Now it’s possible to leverage your most       powerful and valuable asset – your relationships – to support social       selling behaviors.
“As a social seller, you need a holistic view of all your contacts —       and all the social networks where they have a presence,” said Giamanco.       “Without the Nimble Contacts App now available for HootSuite, you’d be       flying blind. With the app, you expand your access to the context that       helps you gauge the immediate needs of customers and leads. Before the       app, you had a narrow view. Now you are a click away from your complete       shared history and details, raising the odds of creating a successful       opportunity.”
“This new app is a real boost to my workflow. It puts all the goodness       of Nimble right there in my HootSuite account,” Giamanco added. “As I       prospect on Hootsuite, Nimble is always at hand to support that process.”
