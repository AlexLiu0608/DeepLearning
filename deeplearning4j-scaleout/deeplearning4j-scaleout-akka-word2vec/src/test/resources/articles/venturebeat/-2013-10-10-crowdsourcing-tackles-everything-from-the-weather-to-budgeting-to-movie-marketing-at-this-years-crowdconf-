“What Can a #Machine Learn from Tweets About the #Weather?” It turns out quite a bit. Alex Sorokin, CrowdFlower’s head of data science, will lead a session at the fourth annual CrowdConf on Oct. 22 in San Francisco, about the possibilities of what a machine can learn from thousands of tweets about the weather. Using the crowd for data mining and machine learning is just one of the many fascinating topics on the agenda for this year’s CrowdConf, which is the longest running crowdsourcing industry event.
An international audience of more than 300 crowdsourcing practitioners, executives, investors, entrepreneurs, and researchers will come together to discuss and share the latest trends in crowdsourcing.
