Who needs a 110-inch TV? And who would pay the price of a luxury car to have one? My bet is only a fraction of the world’s richest 1 percent — but that’s not stopping Samsung.
After showing off a huge 110-inch 4K HDTV at CES last January, Samsung is today finally opening up orders for the set — though it’s not saying how much it will actually cost. Samsung is also only making the gigantic set available in China, the Middle East, and some European countries.
Samsung’s  smaller 85-inch 4K set went for $40,000 when it launched in March, so we can assume the larger set will be significantly more expensive. But in that price range, it’s pretty clear what Samsung is aiming for with these TVs: bragging rights.
4K TV sets were one of the few truly new technologies shown off at CES earlier this year, and they’re poised to be an even bigger deal at CES 2014 next week. But while many manufacturers are merely trying to get 4K sets on the market, Samsung can wield its might by showing off gigantic sets. In the end, it doesn’t matter if only a few dozen of these sets get sold.
Today, most consumers would be better off investing in a home projector setup if they really want a huge screen. You’ll have to settle for 1080p projectors for now (Sony’s 4K home projector costs $25,000), but given the lack of 4K content out there, that’s not a huge loss.
