We’re pleased to announce that Steve Wadsworth, the chief executive of Tapjoy, will speak in a fireside chat with Michael Metzger, a principal at mergers and acquisitions firm Covert & Co., at the  GamesBeat 2013  conference on Oct. 29-Oct. 30 in Redwood City, Calif. They will talk about how to capture brand dollars and capitalize on the mobile ad bonanza in games and apps.

The session will highlight the growing demand for better user experiences within apps — and the need for advertising to keep up with that. Metzger and Wadsworth will discuss the opportunities to drive more value and revenue for app publishers through more effective user acquisition, superior engagement, and app monetization. Consumers don’t like ads that interrupt their games. But marketers and developers want to work together to create a chance to monetize the customer in a free-to-play game in a way that enhances its experience. The monetization has to happen at the right time and place, or it doesn’t happen at all.
Tapjoy monetizes games through ads known as offers where it shows video ads or ads for other games to players who want to get in-game currency in an app or game they are already playing. Wadsworrth became the CEO of Tapjoy last November after joining its board in 2011. He previously ran the Disney Interactive Media Group. He spent 17 years at Disney and rose to the head of the company’s digital media and gaming businesses. Under his watch at Tapjoy, the company is working with 70 of the world’s top brands, and it has a reach of more than 435 million people a month. The company’s ambition is to be the largest reward-based rich media platform for mobile users.
Metzger’s Covert & Co. is an investment bank that provides M&A and finance services for media and tech companies. It has handled numerous transactions for deals in the game business.

Our theme for the conference is the “Battle Royal,” where all companies compete across platforms, territories, digital and physical markets, and categories of games.
We’ve entered an era where many firms are vying for gamers’ time in the same space. Apple and Google want to get in the living room and are waging war against Nintendo and Sony. Microsoft already has an edge in living room entertainment with its Xbox Live service, but it wants a piece of mobile as well. It’s a confusing time for gamemakers. Where should they take their titles? Which platforms will provide the best experiences? Who will make them the most money?
Register here.
We’ll roll out a steady drumbeat of speakers as we get closer to GamesBeat 2013′s October date. We expect to have more than 80 of the gaming industry’s best lined up for our fifth annual event.
Each year, GamesBeat follows a big trend. In 2009, we focused on how “All The World’s a Game,” with the explosion of games on the global stage. In 2010, GamesBeat@GDC focused on “Disruption 2.0.” In 2011, our theme was “Mobile Games Level Up,” investigating the busy intersection of games and mobile technology. In 2012, we  explored “The Crossover Era ,” the time when so many big game companies and startups were transforming themselves by expanding from one market to the next. Our judges, meanwhile, are already busy picking the finalists in the Who’s Got Game Innovation Showdown for the best game startup.
As companies adapt to change, we’re witnessing disruption, adaptation, consolidation, innovation, and the arrival of big money. We’re talking billions of dollars that are at stake. We’re expecting 400 notables from throughout the game industry — social, mobile, online, and console. Please join us.
