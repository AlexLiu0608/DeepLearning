Roambi for iOS 7 A screenshot from Roambi Analytics 7 Source: Roambi
Alsbury said Roambi has been working on the app since June, when iOS 7 was first announced. But even though there’s value in quickly optimizing for iOS 7 , the company wanted to give people a chance to get used to the operating system before releasing the new version of the app.
The one major addition to Roambi in this new version is the “Card View,” which enables you to stuff a bunch of items — charts, tabular data, individual metrics — into a single, interactive dashboard.
This June, Roambi launched a cloud-based version of its service called Roambi Business, which is hosted on Amazon Web Services. It’s seen “tremendous success,” said Alsbury, with a “surprising” number of sign-ups coming from Roambi’s existing, on-premise customer base. Roambi Business features remote administration, security, and publishing features ( more on that here ).
Roambi currently has 90 employees. It has raised $50 million in funding, including a $30 million round from Sequoia Capital in September 2011. Its customers include Airbnb, Pret a Manger, Sydney Airport, and the Dallas Cowboys.
