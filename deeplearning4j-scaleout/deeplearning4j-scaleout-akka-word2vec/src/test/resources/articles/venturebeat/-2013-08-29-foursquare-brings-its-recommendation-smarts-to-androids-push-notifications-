Foursquare is slowly becoming the app CEO Dennis Crowley always wanted it to be.
The company is introducing a new feature to Foursquare’s Android app that will automatically push contextual notifications  to users based on their locations.
Via the notifications Foursquare could, for example, automatically recommend that you visit a restaurant based on your location and then give you a tip about the place once you get there. Foursquare says offer these recommendations even when users don’t check-in. Its data has become that powerful.
As the company describes it, “We think of this feature like a sixth sense: proactive recommendations of things you didn’t even know you were looking for.”
In other words, Foursquare is moving from a pull experience to a push experience. And that just might help it regain some if its lost users, who ditched the check-in-focused Foursquare of old.
Foursquare shares that strategy with apps like Google Now or even Field Trip , which also gives people recommendations based on what’s around them. The difference, however, is that with Foursquare, the recommendations are powered by its 35 million users and 4 billion check-ins.
For longtime Foursquare fans, the new functionality might sound familiar: Foursquare introduced a nearly identical feature called Radar in 2011 , before quickly finding that the app’s drain on battery life and location (in)accuracy made the overall experience lackluster.
Both of those kinks seem to be ironed this time around: One, Foursquare says the extra battery load is negligible – roughly .7 percent per hour, it estimates — and, two, because of all of the check-in data its collected over the years, it says it can sidestep some of the more significant limitations of current location technology.
The feature, which doesn’t have a name, will initially be available only to a select few Android users, with a wider rollout to iOS expected before the end of the year.
