LANDING, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–December 3, 2013–
Layers of software protect data on your desktop and internet security       applications ward off viruses plus hackers. Yet, the “firewall” around       the heart of your business, the data center, is literally made of porous       sheetrock. Every time the door opens, a new set of threats can enter.       Variations in ambiance such as humidity and temperature can affect       operations. Carbon monoxide from fire or water seepage invites disaster.       Humans and energy are essential but just as dangerous; loss of power,       sabotage or theft, will stop a business in its tracks. System       reliability depends on safeguarding against all these possible       combinations of hazards 24/7, 365 days a year.

Once cost prohibitive, the necessary level of on-premise protection is       now available and affordable by even small or medium companies.       Manufactured in Germany ( www.kentix.us )       and used extensively in Europe since 2009, the Kentix Multisensor System       is an IP based, turnkey, rack and server room monitoring solution.       Instead of being a challenge, physical security can now be readily       incorporated into any in-house IT infrastructure.
Engineered to be a completely wireless all-in-one system, an intelligent       sensor detects environmental changes, burglary activity, fire, or       unwanted access; this design simplicity eliminates redundant components       plus streamlines installation and networking. The result is more       accurate information, faster error reporting and immediate correction.       With a hierarchy of Kentix offerings and multiple configuration options,       inherent scalability is built in. Being cost effective is a given,       because disaster recovery is far more expensive than any preventative       measure.
Capable of interpreting very diverse input, the central Kentix       Multisensor unit uses Ethernet and RF ZigBee® based transmitters to       create a mesh network and achieves 360° room coverage. Unlike lesser       systems that are video based, Kentix utilizes infrared motion detectors       to detect unauthorized access. Cameras only record visual information;       they must also be strategically placed to achieve proper coverage. But,       video still requires manpower to constantly view it. A Kentix system       automatically reports atypical vibrations without need of human       intervention. Gas, moisture, noise, temperature extremes, and energy       surges are also reported.
An internal GSM modem enables the Kentix AlarmManager to message real       time error conditions as SMS, Email, or SNMP traps. Messages are       password protected; only authorized personnel can resolve each       situation. A secure Kentix KeyPad can also arm or disarm the       AlarmManager. A Kentix system not only sends warnings, it intervenes.       External devices such as alarms, flashing lights, buzzers or sirens can       be automatically engaged. Other next-step remedial actions are server       dependant and user programmable.
Each component is a standalone unit with independent UPS battery-less       backup; captured reports and settings are refreshed every five minutes       to insure integrity. Video is also an option. With non-proprietary       design and standard protocols like SNMP or OPC, a Kentix Multisensor is       easily integrated into any SCADA or network monitoring system; it also       meets DIN/EN 27000 requirements.
