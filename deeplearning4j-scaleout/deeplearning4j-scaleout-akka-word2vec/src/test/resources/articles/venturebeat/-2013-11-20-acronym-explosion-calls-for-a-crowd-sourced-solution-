Internet slang shorthand can indeed get crazy sometimes, but that’s probably what makes it so great. Just imagine chatting or texting without LOL , BRB , or TTYL . Net-speak surely became a vital resource that we all rely on to simplify many aspects of our daily online communication.
People now create a ridiculously large amount of new acronyms and abbreviations on a daily basis, not only from teenagers on chat rooms but also by large corporations, medical institutions, and the government. Facebook and Twitter memes are not helping, either.
According to studies from several web safety organizations, parents are failing to protect their children in cyberspace because they don’t understand the acronym blitz that feed online exchanges. Apparently, just three out of 10 parents could figure out the popular Internet terms LMIRL , YOLO , or POS .
A few months ago the Oxford University Press announced it added a couple of new terms born from the Internet culture to its Oxford dictionary, among them BYOD (bring your own device), FOMO (fear of missing out?), and TL;DR (too long; didn’t read). While this is helpful, it’s obviously just a little drop in the ocean, something a traditional dictionary publication simply can’t handle.
The explosion of shorthand creativity in recent years called for a more effective way to manage this vibrant and dynamic content arena. That’s why we’ve created Abbreviations.com , a unique reference resource designed specifically and solely for the deciphering and classification of shorthand of all sorts.
Very early, we realized that such a complicated project would have to be a collaborative effort. Dealing with hundred of thousands definitions that keep growing constantly is hardly a task for a couple of editors. We called out for contributing editors from all over the world, and to date there are more than 5,000 registered editors that help keep this living data-organism up-to-date and as accurate as possible.
Claiming to be the de-facto official resource for acronyms, abbreviations and symbols on the web, Abbreviations.com currently holds nearly a million entries organized by a large variety of categories such as computing, the web, governmental, medicine, and business. Our passionate editors will continue expanding it for the benefit of all the acronym-challenged and worried moms out there!
