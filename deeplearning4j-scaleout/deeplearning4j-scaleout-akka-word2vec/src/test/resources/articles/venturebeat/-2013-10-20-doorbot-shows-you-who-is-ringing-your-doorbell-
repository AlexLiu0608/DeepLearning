DoorBot brings your doorbell into the smartphone age. The DoorBot is a doorbell with a WiFi-connected video camera that shows you a live video who is at your front door. When someone visits, the doorbell activates your smartphone and you can see a visual image of who is at your doorstep.

The device works whether you are home or away, enabling you to see and speak with visitors at your doorstep. You can install it at your front door as a replacement for your doorbell. When someone presses the button, the video camera activates and sends live video to your smartphone.
The DoorBot works with Lockitron, which lets you open your door remotely to let family or trusted friends inside. The doorbell has perforated brushed aluminum for its faceplate, and it is designed to endure any weather. The camera can capture video day or night and transfer it to your phone via WiFi. It can be connected through your doorbellâ€™s wiring and can run for a year before needing to be recharged. It uses an internal rechargeable lithium polymer battery.
The device is compatible with iPhone, iPad, and Android devices. You can sync it with multiple smartphones and tablets. It is available now for $199.
DoorBot launched in December 2012 on the Christie Street crowdfunding site and quickly surpassed its $250,000 funding goal. Now it has raised more than $1 million to date.
James Siminoff, the Santa Monica, Calif.-based inventor, created the DoorBot while working in his garage. His problem was that he never heard the doorbell and missed an important package one day. He looked down at his desk in frustration and realized his smartphone was the answer.
