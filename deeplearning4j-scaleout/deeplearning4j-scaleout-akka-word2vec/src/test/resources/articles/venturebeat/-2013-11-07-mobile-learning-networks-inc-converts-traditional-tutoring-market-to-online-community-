$350,000 Seed Round of Funding Enables Market Launch
SAN DIEGO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–November 7, 2013–
Mobile Learning Networks, Inc. – a private tutoring service company       revolutionizing the industry by providing a virtual, one-to-one       experience between student and tutor via an iPad application – announced       it has completed a $350,000 seed round of private funding.
“Private tutoring and test preparation is a large and growing market,       with $60 billion spent globally,” said President Andrew Meyer, who has       over 20 years of senior management experience growing software and       companies, including Websense, Inc., Epicor Software, Worksoft, MSC       Software and Sales Technologies.
“The market is driven by parental concerns about their children’s       academic success, college admission and job prospects – combined with       the lack of resources within the school systems and government-mandated       benchmarks created by No Child Left Behind and Common Core,” Meyer       continued.
Connected to a powerful cloud service, MLN’s iPad app allows students       and tutors to collaborate virtually through tablets, providing an       advanced whiteboard experience, with full audio communication,       handwriting/touch input and advanced graphics. Sessions are recorded and       can be bookmarked, for easy lesson playback.
“Our product’s biggest strength is its convenience factor,” said CTO and       Founder Josh Roach, who was previously senior vice president of       engineering and product management at Mitek Systems, where he       spearheaded the development of mobile products for the banking industry,       including the “Mobile Deposit” application for smart phones. “By       replicating an in-person lesson with a highly interactive application,       our product solves one of the major downsides to tutoring – the time       wasted on commuting.”
The company has developed an exclusive, high-quality marketplace of       tutors, delivering their lessons via the application. The marketplace       provides a single source for parents and students to find tutors whose       services are available virtually via the iPad.
MLN is generating revenue from paying customers, and will make the app       widely available in December via the App Store. The service is currently       available through invitation only beta.
