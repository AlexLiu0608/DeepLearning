What in the world is happening with Foxnews.com? The news site was displaying what looks like regular news peppered with weird alerts and a big “WEEEEEEEEEE” caption.
No really.
Detail of the website saying, “HERE IS SOME STUFF FO YO.”
This certainly looks like it could have beed a hack. However, Fox is claiming it is a tech error with a bunch of placeholder text showing through to the live site. A developer could have pushed a pre-production version of the website to the front accidentally.
It seems only minutes after this post aired, the site went back to its usual self.
“During routine website maintenance, a home page prototype was accidentally moved to the actual site.  As with any mistake in testing, engineers noticed the error and quickly brought the site back to its normal function,” said Fox News chief digital officer Jeff Misenti in a statement emailed to VentureBeat.
If it is a hack, however, it looks to be more like a prankster than a “hacktivism” effort. Defacing websites is a favorite among groups like Anonymous that want to get a message out to a lot of people at one time. But here, we only see bits of weird text such as, “Stuff yo” and “Here is some stuff fo yo” mixed in with regular news.
Another argument for the developer error, however, is that this “regular news” has some old news in it as well, including alerts for “Apple unveils new computers, new software and a Maverick Sea Lion at WWDC 2013″ and “Journalist Hastings sent chilling email before death,” referencing Michael Hastings, who passed away in a car crash last June.
