We’re pleased to announce that Clive Downie, the chief executive of DeNA West, will speak about getting consequential player engagement on mobile in a fireside chat at our  GamesBeat 2013  conference on Oct. 29-Oct. 30 in Redwood City, Calif. Chris Kohler, the editor of Wired Game Life, will moderate the talk.
DeNA West
Clive Downie of DeNA West
The conversation will focus on how mobile devices of all kinds are changing the way people live every aspect of their lives and what that means for the developers who want to target them. When an app engages large numbers of people, it’s a powerful moment and a big business opportunity. But consumers are fickle. Time is a rare commodity, and Downie will share his thoughts on how the mobile community can be harnessed.
As CEO of DeNA West, Downie oversees DeNA’s mobile-social game platform, Mobage West. He also runs the third-party and first-party studio business for DeNA in Western markets. He joined DeNA in 2009. Before that, he spent 15 years at Electronic Arts, where he served as vice president of marketing and managed franchises such as FIFA Soccer in North America and Europe.
DeNA West is a division of Japan’s mobile-social gaming network DeNA, and it is one of the companies trying to capture the success of Asian mobile games and translate it to the Western markets. DeNA West is also working on its own original titles such as The Drowning (pictured above), which debuted earlier this year.

Our theme for the conference is the “Battle Royal,” where all companies compete across platforms, territories, digital and physical markets, and categories of games.
We’ve entered an era where many firms are vying for gamers’ time in the same space. Apple and Google want to get in the living room and are waging war against Nintendo and Sony. Microsoft already has an edge in living room entertainment with its Xbox Live service, but it wants a piece of mobile as well. It’s a confusing time for gamemakers. Where should they take their titles? Which platforms will provide the best experiences? Who will make them the most money?
Register here.
We’ll roll out a steady drumbeat of speakers as we get closer to GamesBeat 2013′s October date. We expect to have more than 80 of the gaming industry’s best lined up for our fifth annual event.
Each year, GamesBeat follows a big trend. In 2009, we focused on how “All The World’s a Game,” with the explosion of games on the global stage. In 2010, GamesBeat@GDC focused on “Disruption 2.0.” In 2011, our theme was “Mobile Games Level Up,” investigating the busy intersection of games and mobile technology. In 2012, we  explored “The Crossover Era ,” the time when so many big game companies and startups were transforming themselves by expanding from one market to the next. Our judges, meanwhile, are already busy picking the finalists in the Who’s Got Game Innovation Showdown for the best game startup.
As companies adapt to change, we’re witnessing disruption, adaptation, consolidation, innovation, and the arrival of big money. We’re talking billions of dollars that are at stake. We’re expecting 400 notables from throughout the game industry — social, mobile, online, and console. Please join us.
