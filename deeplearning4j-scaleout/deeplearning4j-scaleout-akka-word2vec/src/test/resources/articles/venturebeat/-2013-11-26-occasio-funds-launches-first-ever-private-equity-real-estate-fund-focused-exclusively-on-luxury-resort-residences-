DENVER–(BUSINESS WIRE)–November 26, 2013–
With more than 4,100 private equity real estate funds in the world, Occasio       Funds announced today it is the first fund to focus exclusively on       luxury residential resort real estate, capitalizing on the growing $24       billion villa rental industry by partnering with world-class brands to       lease and manage properties as nightly vacation rentals.
“We are pioneering a new asset class and a new way to invest in       residential real estate,” says Ben       Rule , CEO and founder of Occasio (which is Latin for “opportunity”       or “favorable moment”) Funds. “We believe the real estate market –       particularly luxury resort real estate – has reached its bottom and that       professionally operated resort real estate presents a new, powerful       opportunity to diversify and strengthen investment portfolios.”
While residential real estate has become an increasingly popular       investment strategy in recent years, Occasio Funds is the only       professionally managed, institutional investment-level private equity       firm focused solely on acquiring luxury vacation homes in top-tier real       estate markets.
“We are acquiring the best possible properties in the most central and       coveted resort locations,” says Rule. “It’s these properties at       established top-tier resorts that have the highest nightly rental demand       and the best long-term appreciation prospects. And through our unique       relationships with the largest and most successful operators, we have       the ability to effectively and efficiently manage these assets in a way       that has never been done before.”
The firm has already established a pipeline of more than $1 billion in       potential deals through proprietary relationships and industry expertise       established over the past 10 years. To capture the best of these       opportunities, the firm’s first commingled fund, Occasio       Growth Fund I , is targeting a $100 million raise, and is open to       accredited and institutional investors.
Travel research firm PhoCusWright describes the villa rental industry as a “$24.3 billion opportunity in       the U.S. alone.” A 2012 Companies & Markets report depicts the luxury travel market as the travel       industry’s fastest growing segment.
By partnering with world-class luxury destination clubs, exchange       operators and private residence clubs and applying the proven nightly       lease model of hotel investment and management to residential       properties, “we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the growing       consumer trend of renting private homes while on vacation, as well as       acquiring irreplaceable properties at very reasonable prices,” says Rule.
