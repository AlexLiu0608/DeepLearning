SOUTHBOROUGH, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 10, 2013–
RxAdvance, an innovative pharmacy benefit management (PBM) company, has       expanded its executive management team with another industry veteran,       Anand Tati, who joins as executive vice president, operations and client       engagement.
Anand Tati, executive vice president, operations and client engagement,       is responsible for overall operations of the company including engaging       prospective clients and building sustainable trusted client       relationships. In addition, he will lead the onboarding of new clients       and be responsible for defining the RxAdvance platform scope, developing       functional module roadmaps and process blueprints, and executing and       delivering complete client pharmacy benefit management solutions.
Tati brings over 20 years of experience in successful client       implementation, business process re-engineering, and engagement. Prior       to joining RxAdvance, Tati was a senior manager and on the partner track       at Deloitte Consulting. While at Deloitte and as part of the Information       Management practice, Tati provided strategic technology advisory and       implementation services to commercial, federal, and state government       clients such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for       Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Housing and Urban Development       (HUD), Time Warner, and Walmart. Prior to Deloitte, Tati was a product       manager at IMS Health and Millennium Pharmaceuticals, and was a senior       consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers. He began his career at Infosys as       a software engineer.
“The PBM industry is known for ‘business as usual’ and has been       challenged to bring real value to plan sponsors (health plans, ACO’s,       FFS government programs, self-funded groups) in addition to traditional       transaction management. The PBM space is filled with multiple,       fragmented, inflexible, and homegrown legacy systems that are expensive       to operate, and hence unable to provide desired outcomes at the point of       care and point of sale,” says Ravi       Ika , Founder and CEO of RxAdvance. Ika adds, “Healthcare reform adds       additional pressure on the plan sponsor’s PBM to demonstrate effective       prescription benefit management through reduced adverse drug effects,       better medication therapy management, comprehensive medication review,       improved prescription adherence, reduced fraud and abuse, increased       usage of generics, optimal usage of specialty medications including       switching to low cost specialty drugs, and improving pharmacy related       Star Ratings. Such value-added services require us to think outside the       box and achieve the highest degree of sophistication within RxAdvance to       deliver actionable information at the point of care and point of       sale.” Ika says, “Anand brings such experience in business process       re-engineering, thinking outside the box, and a game changing approach       in implementation solutions.”
Tati has a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering from the       National Institute of Technology, India, and a masters in technology       management from Penn Engineering and the Wharton School.
