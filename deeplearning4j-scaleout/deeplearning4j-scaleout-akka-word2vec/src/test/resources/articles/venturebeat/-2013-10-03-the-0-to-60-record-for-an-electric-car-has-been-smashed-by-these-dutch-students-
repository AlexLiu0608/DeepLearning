Sure, efficiency is important. But speed is fun.
Students from the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands have broken the 0-to-60-miles-per-hour record for an electric car, according to  Motor Authority .
And they did it in a car they built themselves.
That car, the DUT13, did 0 to 100 kph (0 to 62 mph) in 2.15 seconds, obliterating the previous record of 2.68 seconds.
The students even managed to beat the 0-to-60-mph record for a production car: 2.3 seconds set by a 500-horsepower Ariel Atom V-8 in 2010.
It’s also more than a second quicker the monstrous, 740-hp Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Electric Drive .
“We thought that under these conditions we’d be happy with 2.30,” team manager Tim de Moree told journalists. “But we really didn’t expect 2.15.”
The DUT13 is powered by four wheel-mounted electric motors, each producing 25 kilowatts (33 hp). That makes for a total power output of 100 kW (132 hp). Electric motors’ instantly-available torque is perfect for acceleration records.
And the motors had very little weight to push around: The entire car weighs just 320 pounds, thanks to a carbon fiber-reinforced plastic monocoque chassis.
The 6.3-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack contributes only 95 pounds to the total weight.
The team’s obsession with saving weight even influenced the choice of driver: 24-year-old Marly Kuijpers was the lightest member of the group of almost two dozen students.
