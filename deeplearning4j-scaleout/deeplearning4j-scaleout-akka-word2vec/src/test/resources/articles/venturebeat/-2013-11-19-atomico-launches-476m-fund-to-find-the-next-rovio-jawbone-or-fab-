The next Rovio is out there somewhere, and Atomico wants to help fund it.
The international VC firm has closed i ts latest fund, Atomico III , and says it will use this fund to continue finding and supporting growth stage companies — “primarily those outside Silicon Valley.”
Founded in 2006, Atomico has had more than its share of successes over the past few years. Its portfolio includes big exits from companies like Last.Fm (picked up by CBS for $280 million), and Seesmic (bought by Hootsuite last year). It has also funded successful companies like Jawbone, Fab, and taxi hailing app maker Hailo.
Oh, and there’s also Angry Birds maker Rovio, which Atomico helped pour $42 million into back in 2011.
There have been big recent successes as well. Free-to-play game developer Supercell, for instance,  landed a big investment from Softbank and GungoHo  – and a $3 billion valuation. The Climate Corporation, which sells real-time weather insurance to farmers, was acquired by  agriculture giant Monsanto for $1.1 billion last month .
In other words, Atomico knows a good company when it sees it.
