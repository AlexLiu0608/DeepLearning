What kids do with their smartphones
The media-fueled furor over sexting and other smartphone infractions has certainly had an impact on parent’s behavior with their kids’ mobile devices, but just four percent of teen’s texts involve adult or sexual content, and only two percent contain images. Another two percent of texts from teens contain references to drugs, according to TxtWatcher, which makes a parental spying app that allows parents to keep an eye on what their kids are communicating.
According to Harris, A quarter of kids under 17 have a “smartphone contract” with their parents governing what they can or can’t do, and another 19 percent have a curfew after which the device must switched off. For those under 12 with passwords on their phones, just under half must share them with their parents.
And in school?
Almost half of kids are texting while in class, parents believe, while slightly fewer kids actually admit to it. Which doesn’t, of course, mean that the texts aren’t about legitimate schoolwork questions — although most schools will confiscate devices used in class for a day or two.
A quarter of kids aged 8-12 own a smartphone, which rises to 61 percent of teens age 13-18. About 52 percent of adults own a smartphone.
