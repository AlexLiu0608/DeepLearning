Trusted Insight is bringing together the people who manage a significant portion of the world’s wealth. This online network for limited partners (LPs) today raised some funding of its own.
Trusted Insight has over 58,000 members, who constitute one-third of the world’s institutional investors. These LPs come from private equity funds, hedge funds, pension funds, endowments, family offices, real estate funds, banks, insurance companies, foundations, and sovereign wealth funds. On average, they manage more than $5 billion. They use Trusted Insight to communicate with professional contacts, make new connections, find investment opportunities, and interact with fund managers who may be looking for capital, along the lines of AngelList. Profiles contain information about background, skills, investments, connections etc… and they can keep track of their peers’ activity.
The platform is more than a social network, however. Investors can monitor their portfolios and seek support with due diligence.  Trusted Insight also delivers customized content based on investors’ expressed areas of interest. They can stay current on relevant news on topics like “commercial real estate,” “cloud computing,” and “Indonesia.” Trusted Insight also has features to post job listings and events.
“The inspiration came from Max Levchin who said the best content is going to be user-generated,” CEO Alex Bangash said in an interview with VentureBeat. “The practitioners of institutional investment know more than any single advisor or investor, and if you could crowdsource that knowledge and create a community, that would be powerful. On general social networks like LinkedIn or Facebook, the signal is lost. On Trusted Insight, the signal is strong.”
Bangash previously founded the Rumson Group, an advisory firm that specialized in venture capital and private equity investments.
Investor Garry Tan said that if you added up the assets under management of all the users, it would be trillions of dollars. Trusted Insight’s goal is to be the online place where the people who manage this money go for news and networking, and become a vital source of information. Ultimately the business model will be to deliver relevant information, products, and services to its community.
Other investors include Data Collective, Founders Fund, RRE Ventures, Morado Ventures, Real Ventures, 500 Startups, Alexis Ohanian, Eric Chen, and Marleen Groen. It is based in New York and has 10 employees. The company did not disclose the amount of the round.
