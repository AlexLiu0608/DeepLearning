In the unlikely case that you’re both a fan of Windows Phone and someone who wants a large screened smartphone, I present to you the Nokia Lumia 1520.
Outed by the relentless gadget leaker Evleaks , the Lumia 1520 appears to share a similar design to Nokia’s other Lumia Windows Phone models. The big difference is its screen, which is expected to be six inches running at a 1080p resolution.
With that screen size and resolution, the 1520 should be an interesting case study for how well Microsoft’s “Live Tiles” Windows Phone home screen scales. From the picture above, it already looks much more cluttered than any Windows Phone I’ve seen. (Thankfully, you have a lot of control over how tiles are displayed and managed in Windows Phone 8.)
The Lumia 1520 is expected to sport a quad core Snapgdragon processor and will launch with the latest version of Windows Phone, reports the Verge .
Even though I have large hands, I still don’t see much of a point with phones this large. Samsung’s Galaxy Note series was the first large-screened phone lineup to be successful (they’re called “phablets” since they’re like a cross between smartphones and tablets), and now we’re seeing similar models from most other smartphone makers, like LG and HTC.
Honestly, these companies would likely be better off focusing on making their mainstream smartphones more innovative, rather than making huge phones for a niche audience.
