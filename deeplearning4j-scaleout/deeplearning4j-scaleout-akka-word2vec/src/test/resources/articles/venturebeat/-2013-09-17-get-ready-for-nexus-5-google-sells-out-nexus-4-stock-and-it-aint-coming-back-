Here’s yet another sign that the Nexus 5 is near: Google sold out of all of its current Nexus 4 stock on Monday, and according to the Verge , it won’t be returning.
The LG-built Nexus 4 debuted last fall , and at this point it’s due for a replacement. With the iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S announced and gearing up for release, Google could undercut Apple by announcing its next major Android phone.
We’ve seen several glimpses of the Nexus 5, the Nexus 4′s successor, over the past few months. A  Federal Communications Commission filing  notes the Nexus 5 will include LTE 4G (the lack of which was the Nexus 4′s biggest deficiency) and will also be built by LG. It also made an “accidental” appearance in the promo video for the latest version of Android, dubbed KitKat. (if you really think Google didn’t plan that Nexus 5 tease, I’ve got a bridge to sell you.)
The Nexus 5 is expected to have a 5-inch screen (naturally), and a new Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor. I’m hoping it also fixes the Nexus 4′s crummy camera.
The Nexus lineup initially started out as Android’s go-to flagship phones, but now we’re seeing major releases from Samsung and HTC surpassing Nexus capabilities. Now, the Nexus phones are notable for offering the purest Android experience possible, with immediate updates from Google and no extra software. The Nexus 4 was also one of the best deals for an off-contract Android smartphone, starting at $299 for the 8GB version when first released.
With the Moto X targeting more mainstream smartphone consumers, the same demographic that Apple’s iPhone 5C is aiming for, I wouldn’t be surprised to see the Nexus 5 focusing on more demanding buyers. It will likely be Android’s biggest competition against Apple’s iPhone 5S.
