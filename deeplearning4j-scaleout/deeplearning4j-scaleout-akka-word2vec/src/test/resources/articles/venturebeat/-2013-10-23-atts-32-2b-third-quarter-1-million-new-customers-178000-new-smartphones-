AT&T’s latest earnings report shows yet again why it’s still a good time to be in the wireless business.
The company third posted third-quarter revenues of $32.2 billion, a 2.2 percent increase over the same point last year. Analysts expected 65 cents a share on revenue of $32.19 billion.
All of this lead to overall profits of $3.8 billion for the company.
On the subscriber side, AT&T said it added one million new subscribers, though only 178,000 signed on with smartphones. Still,  AT&T said that smartphones accounted for 89 percent of its postpaid revenue, which is a new record for the company.
AT&T’s earnings come  a week after Verizon reported third-quarter revenues of $30.3 billion. Neither company seems to be hurting all that much by the efforts of T-Mobile, which is making a lot of noise by shaking up the way the two big carriers do business.
