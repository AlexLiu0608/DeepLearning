After carving out a solid niche in the mobile economy with in-depth app analytics, App Annie announced today that it has scored $15 million in a third round of funding led by Sequoia Capital.
The company’s analytics tools lets publishers measure the performance of their apps across multiple app stores, as well as get download and revenue estimates. App Annie also aggregates those insights into reports that have become essential for reporters, investors, and anyone looking to learn about the latest app trends.
App Annie says it will use the funding to expand its product develop, as well as to grow its presence in Asia and Europe. The company notes that it has doubled its user base over the last year, and it’s also tripled its monthly recurring revenues. More than 90 percent of the biggest iOS app publishers by revenue are using App Annie’s tools, the company says.
There are plenty of analytics tools out there trying to extract some sort of meaningful insight from the app economy, but App Annie has always stood out from the pack for me. Earlier this year the company noted that Android’s app revenue was growing 10 times faster than the iOS store, and last year it pointed out that Apple’s app store revenues grew by just 13 percent ( a figure that had Apple fuming ).
As part of the new funding, the company is adding Sequoia Capital’s Tim Lee to its board, as well as uSamp CEO Alan Gould. Lee noted in a statement that Sequoia is currently using App Annie’s product to find hot startups.
San Francisco, Calif.-based App Annie has now raised a total of $22 million. Other investors in this round include Greycroft Partners, IDG Capital Partners, e.ventures and Infinity Venture Partners.
