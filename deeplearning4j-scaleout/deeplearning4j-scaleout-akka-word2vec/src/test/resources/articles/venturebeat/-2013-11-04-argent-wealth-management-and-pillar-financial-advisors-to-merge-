BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–November 4, 2013–
Argent       Wealth Management and Pillar       Financial Advisors have merged effective November 1, 2013. The new       firm, now known as Argent Wealth Management, LLC, will manage a combined       $1.2 billion in client assets and will continue to offer a full spectrum       of investment, tax, financial and estate planning services. The two       firms will operate in their current locations until January 2014 when       they will merge operations in Waltham.
Individually both greatly respected, fee-only firms have been providing       independent investment and financial advisory services to high net worth       individuals for over 20 years. The combined firm will continue to meet       the needs of clients desiring objective advice and customized solutions.
“The Argent / Pillar merger is a merger of two firms of roughly equal       size in terms of assets, numbers of clients and staff. Both firms, which       have always admired and respected one another, are thriving as separate       entities,” said Argent president and founder David Duchesneau. “Our new       company will be even better and deeper, with synergies and complementary       strengths that exceed the stand-alone resources of the individual       firms,” he added.
“Combining our firms gives us the ability to grow while remaining a       private company, with capabilities that are among the most       sophisticated, comprehensive and respected in our industry,” said Pillar       president William Baldwin. “That’s good for our business and our       employees, and, most of all, the clients we serve.” Mr. Baldwin is a       past Chairman of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors       (NAPFA), the nation’s leading organization dedicated to the advancement       of fee-only comprehensive financial planning.
Both firms have highly credentialed professionals – attorneys, CPAs,       CFA® charterholders and CFP® professionals – and take a team approach to       helping clients coordinate and manage today’s difficult financial       decisions. As Argent Wealth Management, they will continue to provide       superior service, personal attention and sophisticated investment and       financial solutions.
“These firms have proud track records of consistent and successful       personal service, a foundation that has yielded lasting relationships       with clients as their needs and goals evolve,” said Pillar Executive       Vice President Beth Gamel. “We share a dedication to our clients and a       commitment to delivering wisdom, knowledge and understanding, not just       data and statistics.” For seven consecutive years Worth Magazine named Gamel as one of the “best financial advisers” in the country, and       in 2010 the Boston Estate Planning Council selected her as its Estate       Planner of the Year.
DeVoe & Company acted as a consultant to Pillar Financial Advisors and       Argent Wealth Management, providing business strategy guidance to help       the organizations evaluate a proposed merger.
