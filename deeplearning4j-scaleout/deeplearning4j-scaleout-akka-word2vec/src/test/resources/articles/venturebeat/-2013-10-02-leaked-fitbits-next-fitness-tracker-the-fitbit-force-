Fitbit’s fitness trackers could soon take a big step forward.
Fitbit, the maker of the popular fitness device called the Fitbit Flex, is producing a follow-up device, the Fitbit Force, that will function as a watch among other things.
The Verge has gotten its hands on promotional shots .
The device — which will likely be sold alongside, not in place of, the Fitbit Flex — seems to improve on the Fitbit wristband formula in every major way. In addition to being water-resistant, the Fitbit Force comes with an altimeter, which will let it track users’ elevation during hikes and as they go up and down stairs. (This has been  a notable omission with the Flex .)
Most notably, though, is that unlike the Fitbit Flex, the Fitbit Force will also function as a watch. This is huge because it vastly increases the chance that owners of the device will keep it on their wrists all day. And that can only lead to greater, more robust datasets.
Forget the Samsung Galaxy Gear — this is what we want from our smartwatches.

The Fitbit Force looks a whole lot like the Fitbit Flex — but with some major additions.
The Fitbit Force will come in at least two colors and should sell for $130; that’s $30 more than the $100 Fitbit Flex and the same price as the Jawbone Up.
The leak comes two months after Fitbit raised $43 million in a funding round led by investors from the Foundry Group, True Ventures, and Softbank Capital. At the time, Fitbit CEO James Park said the money would be used to hire new employees and — surprise — develop new products.
