If you thought Edward Snowden’s renown as a famed leaker of corporate secrets has made him unemployable for life, you thought wrong.
The man who got us all to second-guess how we use the Internet has apparently gotten himself a new job — as tech support specialist at a Russian web company.
Yeah, we know.
The announcement comes via Snowden’s lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, who wouldn’t tell the Russian Press exactly which company Snowden is working for.  One possibility, though is Russian Facebook VK, which offered him a job back in August.
The news is almost too nutty to believe, but it also makes its own kind of sense: Snowden may be one of the most famous people in the world right now, but he can’t feed himself with notoriety.
Still, it’s hard to imagine that whatever Russian company hired Snowden isn’t taking a major risk by bringing him on. After all, this is the guy who worked at his previous company, Booz Allen Hamilton, for less than three months before he leaked highly sensitive information and fled the country.
So you might say he has a few gaps in his resume.
Regardless of which company Snowden is working for, I’m sure they’re keeping him far, far away from their big secrets.
