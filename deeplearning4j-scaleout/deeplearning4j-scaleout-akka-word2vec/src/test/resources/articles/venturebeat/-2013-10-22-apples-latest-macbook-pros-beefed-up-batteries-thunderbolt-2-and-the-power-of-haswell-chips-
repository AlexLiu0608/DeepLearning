It’s Apple Christmas yet again today as the company unveiled new iPads, a new Mac Pro, even refreshed MacBook Pros at a press briefing in San Francisco.
The latest Pros, which come in 13-inch and 15-inch varieties, offer all the major upgrades you’d expect by this point — faster 802.11ac Wi-Fi , Thunderbolt 2, and, as expected, Mavericks, the latest version of OSX ( which is also completely free ).
Also a big deal: The new MacBooks finally add Intel’s latest Haswell chips, which promise boosts in power, performance, and most importantly, battery life. Apple is claiming 9 hours for the 13-inch MacBook Pro, and 8 hours for the 15-inch version.
With the addition, the new MacBook Pros  join the MacBook Air, which added Haswell chips back in June.
While the previous 15-inch MacBook Pro started at $2,199, the latest one starts at $1,999 for 2.0GHz quad-core, 8GB DRAM, and a 256GB SSD. The 13-inch version, in contrast,  will start at $1,299 for 2.4GHz processor, 4GB RAM,  and 128GB SSD.
Both versions of the new MacBook Pro are available starting today.
