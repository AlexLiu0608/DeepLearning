The latest numbers from research firm eMarketer show a more competitive side of Facebook — and a much bigger target on Google’s back when it comes to ad dollars.
If the future of consumer computing lies in mobile, and if the monetization of the Internet is destined to lean heavily on advertising, Facebook is the fastest-growing contender for the majority of the pie. Meanwhile, Google’s growth is drastically slowing down.
According to data released today, Facebook is expected to grow a huge 10 percent year-over-year in its take of global mobile ad revenue, while reigning champ Google is set to grow by just one percent. The scary part (for Google, anyhow) is that Facebook just started offering mobile ads last year.
Some perspective: Between 2011 and 2012, Google’s mobile ad revenue share grew by 14 percent. From that figure down to one is a long, steep tumble.
Mobile ad revenue has been the bright, shining star of Facebook’s earnings reports since late last year. For the second quarter of 2013, the company revealed that a full 41 percent of its total revenue came from mobile .
“When it comes to mobile, I’m very pleased with the results. … Soon, we’ll have more revenue on mobile than on desktop ,” said CEO Mark Zuckerberg in the earnings call.
