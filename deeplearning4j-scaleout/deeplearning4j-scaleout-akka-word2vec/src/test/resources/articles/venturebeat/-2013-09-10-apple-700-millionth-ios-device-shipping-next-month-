Apple is pumping up iOS 7 as it is unveiling the new operating system at the Apple Event in Cupertino today.
“Next month, we will ship our 700 millionth iOS device,” Apple engineering VP Craig Federighi said on stage. “And since we make updates easy … iOS 7 will quickly become the world’s most popular operating system.”
That’s a major accomplishment, and I’m not just talking about the number of devices. Google just announced that one billion Android devices have been activated, which sounds like more … but because Android is a somewhat fragmented mobile operating system, iOS 7 will have more users than any one flavor of Android, including Jelly Bean, Gingerbread, or the latest version of the operating system, KitKat.
Of course, fragmentation on Android is less of a problem than it used to be , but Federighi is still right.
The real question now is:
How will Apple’s new iPhone 5S and cheaper iPhone 5C change the picture? How much of its mobile market share will those products help Apple regain?
