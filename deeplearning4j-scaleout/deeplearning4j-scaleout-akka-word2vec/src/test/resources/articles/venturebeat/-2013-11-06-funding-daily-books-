We get many books sent to VentureBeat, but today was the first time we had both a hardback and a paperback of the same book sent to one reporter.
Doesn’t seem like a huge deal, right? I mean, maybe they just wanted to give us options. Because sometimes you just can’t appreciate a flimsy book cover. You need something sturdy! But what if you’re going on the train and you want to pick up where you left off with a book that’s a little less hefty? Hello, paperback!
Sounds kind of like those reading apps where you put a book on your phone or PC and then it remembers your place no matter what device you’re on. But, no, this is some real new-age innovation here, people.
What does this have to do with funding? A word to the wise: don’t spend your funding on sending two sets of the same book. They will inevitably be stacked up under a Macbook Air to create a makeshift monitor.
