PHOENIX–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 3, 2013–
Synergis       Education , one of the fastest growing providers of premier       educational services for nonprofit colleges and universities, is pleased       to announce the appointment of Paul Gleason to the post of chief       operating officer. Gleason assumes the lead operational role just after       Synergis completed a $33M       Series A financing in September. His leadership will further enable       the company to partner with an expanding list of universities to fund,       build and grow high quality academic programs for non-traditional       students.
“We are very excited to now have the leadership and experience Paul       brings to our company,” said Synergis CEO and co-founder Norm Allgood.       “He will increase our ability to build open, trust-based relationships       with leading university partners.”
Prior to joining Synergis, Gleason served as the COO of Pearson Embanet,       leading operations while the company grew from $40 million to over $120       million in revenue over five years. Gleason oversaw operations, daily       P&L management, and executive level client relationships for the       organization, working with some of the country’s most prominent       universities to launch and grow more than 100 fully online programs.
With a decade and a half of higher education leadership experience,       Gleason brings extensive academic operations and instructional       technology development experience to his role serving leading       institutions.
“Synergis has an unwavering commitment to delivering superior learning       outcomes for students,” said Gleason. “I look forward to working in       concert with current and new university partners to build high quality       innovative programs that reflect the culture, values and expertise of       each institution.”
Gleason received his master’s and doctorate degrees in education from       Vanderbilt University’s Peabody College. While pursuing his doctoral       studies, he served as an instructor with Vanderbilt’s undergraduate       human and organizational development program, teaching organization       theory and behavior. He completed his M.A. and B.A. at Wheaton College       in Illinois.
