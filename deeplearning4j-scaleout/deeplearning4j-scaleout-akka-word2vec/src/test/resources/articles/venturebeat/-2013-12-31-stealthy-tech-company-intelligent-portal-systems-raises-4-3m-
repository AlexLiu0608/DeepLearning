Intelligent Portal Systems, a technology startup in San Jose so secretive that it doesn’t have a website, just raised $4.3 million, according to a filing the company made yesterday to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Private investors exclusively participated in the round, according to a post about the funding from MarketBrief.
And more funding could be on the way. Another SEC filing from the company this week shows the company plans an additional $450,000 round , but it has only raised $71,000 of that total so far.
The startup’s chief executive, David Russell, didn’t respond to VentureBeat’s requests for comment on the funding.
Russell previously worked for the Amdahl Corp., which is now a division of Fujitsu, and the Institute for Scientific Simulation, according to his LinkedIn profile .
Russell also provides high-level information about Intelligent Portal Systems on his LinkedIn page:
IPS was founded in the fall of 2011 to develop advanced web-based, general purpose expert systems technologies, initially for users in the worldwide markets of education and the engineering sciences. As its technologies evolve, IPS will increasingly broaden its markets to include larger classes of users.
Scott Lundering, a former legal director at Oracle, calls himself a consultant to the company on his LinkedIn profile . Lundering is listed as a director and executive officer in the SEC filings.
We’ll update this post further if we can learn more about the company.
