OMAHA, Neb.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–December 9, 2013–
Prairie Cloudware has recently completed a $1.65 million capital raise. The company is an Omaha-based early stage startup focused on building solutions that allow bank and credit union customers to make mobile payments in a safe and convenient manner.
Founders Treetop Ventures and Croghan Investments, both with deep roots in the payments industry, led the round in partnership with Nebraska Global, Nelnet, Tetrad Corporation and other local angel investors. The capital raised in this round will be used for research and development as well as prototyping key components in the Prairie Cloudware solution set.
“Our goal is to build a world class company on the Silicon Prairie that will play a major role in enabling financial institutions to support the customer’s desire to safely use mobile devices to purchase goods and services,” states Kevin Kammer, CEO of Prairie Cloudware. “With the support of our investors, we have begun building our team and our prototype as we tap into the rich payment and software development expertise available in Omaha, Lincoln and the surrounding areas.”
“Gartner predicts that by 2017 the mobile payments market will be worth $721 billion and feature 450 million users worldwide,” continues Kammer. “The investment community in the United States sees that potential. In 2012, more than a billion dollars of venture capital was invested in mobile payments related technology companies. Prairie Cloudware, unlike many of these organizations, is focused solely on building mobile payment solutions for banks and credit unions.”
Patrick Smith, co-founder and COO of Nebraska Global adds, “Our commitment is to facilitate the growth and development of early stage Nebraska technology companies with the potential to deliver innovative solutions to the marketplace. Prairie Cloudware is one of those companies. Mobile devices will be the preferred option for the purchase of goods and services in the future. We believe financial institutions that wish to protect their payment franchise will look to companies like Prairie Cloudware to provide them with solutions that do just that.”
