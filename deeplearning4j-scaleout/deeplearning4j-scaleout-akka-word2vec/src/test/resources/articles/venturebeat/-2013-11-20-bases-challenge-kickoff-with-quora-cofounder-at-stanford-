The Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students ( BASES ) announced its 2013 BASES Challenge Kickoff, which is today (Nov. 20) at Stanford University’s Paul Brest Hall at 6 p.m. Pacific. Quora founder Charlie Cheever will deliver the evening’s keynote followed by a panel discussion with this past spring’s BASES Challenge winners from Addy, FlameStower, and ALICE.
“In the last two years, the BASES Challenge has grown significantly. In the process, we’ve realized that some of the greatest values that the program provides are the relationships and skills that participants gain,” said John Yang-Sammataro, BASES president.
The BASES Challenge is Stanford’s landmark event, awarding hundreds of thousands of dollars to startups with business plans and demo products in categories such as technology, education, social enterprise, clean tech, and health care. With its first E-Challenge held in 1995, the business plan competition has evolved with the growth of the Silicon Valley to reflect the changing nature of entrepreneurship on campus, including the addition of the social entrepreneurship and product showcase competitions.
The competition has connected top Stanford engineering and business talent with investors and potential mentors. Companies such as Kiva, Law Gives, and Courserank have gone through the BASES Challenge, which in addition to the competition component features a strong mentor and an accelerator program. Over the years, participating companies have gone on to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in funding.
The evening will begin with a panel discussion led by the founders of Addy , FlameStower , and ALICE, the respective winners of the 2013 E-Challenge, Product Showcase and Social E-Challenge competitions. Of note, Addy is an online application that enables people to share any location with a simple, custom link, which is particularly interesting and useful in developing countries that do not have standardized address systems. Addy has also participated in Stanford’s StartX accelerator and raised funding from First Round Capital’s Dorm Room Fund and various angel investors.
“As exciting as these startups are that come out of the Challenge directly, it is even more exciting to view BASES participants three or four years out and see how the skills and relationships they built from the BASES Challenge made an impact on their later success whether with the company they entered into the challenge or later ventures,” said Yang-Sammataro.
