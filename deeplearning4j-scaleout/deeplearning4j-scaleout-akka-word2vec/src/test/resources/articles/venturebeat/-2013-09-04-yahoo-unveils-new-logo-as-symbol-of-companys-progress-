Yahoo has released its new logo. It will begin appearing on company properties tonight, according to a post on the company blog.
“We wanted a logo that stayed true to our roots (whimsical, purple, with an exclamation point) yet embraced the evolution of our products,” CMO Kathy Savitt said.
Yahoo announced on August 6th that it would introduce a new logo in the next month. The new logo is intended to “reflect this spirit of innovation” and ”be a modern redesign that’s more reflective of our remained design and new experiences,” Savitt said at the time.
Over the course of the month, Yahoo changed the logo everyday, making small alterations on the old version. This initiative was called the “30 days of change” and intended to emphasize the “renewed sense of purpose and progress at Yahoo.”
Yahoo has undergone significant transformation over the past year, ever since it brought Marissa Mayer on board as CEO. Mayer was Google’s 20th employee and joined Yahoo in July 2012 to turn the struggling company around.
And she has done just that. Yahoo posted quarterly earnings of $1.135 billion in July, beating estimates and boosting stock prices. She has also made a series of high-profile acquisitions, such as Tumblr , and a series of acqui-hires made a significant effort to bring talented people into the fold.
Yahoo also made major design changes to Yahoo Mail, Yahoo News, and the homepage, and shut down a series of products in an effort to focus more on the products that are doing well.
