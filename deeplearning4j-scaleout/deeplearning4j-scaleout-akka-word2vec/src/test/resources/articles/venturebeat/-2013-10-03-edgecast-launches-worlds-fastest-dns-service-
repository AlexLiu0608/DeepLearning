New offering delivers best overall performance, industry leading       features, and aggressive pricing to the DNS space
SANTA MONICA, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 3, 2013–
EdgeCast       Networks today announced EdgeCast Route, the company’s new globally       distributed DNS (Domain Name System) service.
DNS is required to ensure that a web site is available to end users, yet       it is often neglected, under-prioritized, or deployed on old and       insecure infrastructure. This means that many online enterprises are at       risk for degraded performance, malicious attacks, or worse – being       unreachable via their domain names.
After an extensive review of the existing DNS market, EdgeCast sees an       opportunity to offer enterprise-grade DNS features and functionality       with a simple and cost-effective pricing structure. Customers switching       from competitors are likely to realize significant savings while       benefiting from vastly superior performance and functionality.
“During our testing of EdgeCast Route, we found the performance to be in       a league of its own,” said Ivan Lopez, CEO of Wauwaa. “Until we learned       about EdgeCast Route, we hadn’t realized what a huge difference       enterprise-grade DNS could make. Graduating from a mom-and-pop DNS       service to a solution such as EdgeCast Route will have a huge impact.”
“In third-party testing, EdgeCast Route was the fastest overall       performer among all the major DNS providers – in many cases by a       substantial margin,” said Ted Middleton, VP of product management at       EdgeCast Networks. “Coupling that performance with sophisticated       features like near instant health-checks, automatic failover, load       balancing and advanced policy (geography or network-based) routing,       EdgeCast Route is clearly differentiated against any other managed DNS       service. This combination of performance and features – offered at       prices that are among the most aggressive in the industry – brings a       very powerful new alternative to the market.”
EdgeCast Route is based on DNS technology that – for more than two years       – has been directing traffic to the tens of thousands of EdgeCast       servers around the world that deliver more than 5% of all web traffic.
Route leverages EdgeCast’s massive global IP Anycast network, with       points of presence in most major metros across five continents. The       service has been tested extensively with customer applications using       backbone, real-user (RUM), and mobile measurement agents from several       third-party performance measurement services – a methodology that helps       prevent manipulation by service providers to improve testing results.       These tests showed that EdgeCast Route provides performance improvements       from 15% to more than 300% depending on competitor and region.
The new service also incorporates extensive security capabilities, with       resilience against DDoS attacks, known exploits in traditional DNS       software, and a variety of other exposures. With DNS playing such a       critical infrastructure role and being a very common attack target, the       solution provides enhanced assurance that sites will survive even the       most substantial attacks.
Fully RFC-compliant, EdgeCast Route can function as either a managed       (primary) or secondary DNS, with easy-to-use zone management features       available via the EdgeCast portal or a set of public APIs.
The new service is available immediately, with more information       available at: http://www.edgecast.com/services/route-managed-dns/ .
