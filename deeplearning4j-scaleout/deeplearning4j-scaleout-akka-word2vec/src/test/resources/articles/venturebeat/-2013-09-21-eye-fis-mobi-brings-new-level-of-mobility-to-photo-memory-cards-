Eye-Fi’s newest photo memory card makes it a lot easier to upload photos to the web. The Mobi came out earlier this month and it makes your photos even more mobile ready than earlier memory cards.
Eye-Fi makes a whole line of memory cards with built-in WiFi networking, so they can be uploaded on the fly as you take them and synced to your laptop or web site, so long as you have a WiFi connection.
Now the Eye-Fi Mobi also lets you automatically transfer your photos, which you can take on any camera that supports an SD memory card, to your smartphone or tablet.
The $50 card (8 gigabytes or $80 for 16 gigabytes) creates its own short-range WiFi network so that it can transfer photos to your WiFi-enabled smartphone or tablet.
You have download a free app for the iPhone, iPad, Kindle Fire, or Android. You open the app and pair the card with your phone using Bluetooth capability. You enter your iOS password and the identification code on the Mobi. That makes sure that the card transfers images to your phone via WiFi.
I watched a demo of the card recently and it worked instantly.
The card will transfer photos and videos whenever it detects new content on the camera. Once the transfer completes, the card disconnects its WiFi to save on your phone’s battery life.
This lets you take advantage of your stand-alone camera’s better quality and your ability to share via your smartphone or tablet. From your phone, you can easily share the photos or videos on Facebook, Instagram Camera Awesome, text message, or email.
