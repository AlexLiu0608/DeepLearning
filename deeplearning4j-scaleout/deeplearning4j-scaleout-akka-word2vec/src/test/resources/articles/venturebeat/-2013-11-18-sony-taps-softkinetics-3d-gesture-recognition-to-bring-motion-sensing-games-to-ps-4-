SoftKinetic announced today that its gesture-recognition technology is being used to bring motion-sensing games to the PlayStation 4.
Brussels, Belgium-based SoftKinetic has provided its Iisu middleware to Ubisoft for its motion-sensing dance game Just Dance 2014 for the PlayStation 4. To play the game with gesture recognition, gamers have to buy the PlayStation Camera for the PS4, which went on sale last Thursday for $400. The camera costs an additional $60.
SoftKinetic’s Iisu middleware is a rival to Microsoft’s Kinect motion-sensing system for the Xbox One and the Xbox 360. SoftKinectic provides skeletal analysis and gesture recognition for developers who want to leverage the 3D tracking capability of the PS4′s camera. With Iisu, Just Dance 2014 can detect up to four players at a time. By comparison, Microsoft’s new Kinect can detect six players with the Xbox One version of the game.
The Iisu middleware works across platforms, including set-top boxes, smart TVs, PCs, laptops, and game consoles.  
“We are excited to work with Sony Computer Entertainment to bring our award-winning 3D gesture recognition middleware to game titles for the PS4,” said Michel Tombroff, CEO of SoftKinetic. “We recognize that the game developer community is one of the most technically-advanced ecosystems, and we have therefore been very dedicated to providing the most sophisticated technology for the PS4. We are confident that the 3D gesture recognition capabilities will not only meet, but exceed, that of any other gaming console on the market today.”
