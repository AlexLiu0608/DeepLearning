We’re thrilled to announce that Ruby on Rails creator David “DHH” Heinemeir Hansson will be speaking at DevBeat, Nov. 12-Nov. 13, 2013, in San Francisco.
DevBeat is VentureBeat’s first-ever developer conference, and we wanted to make it extra-special and extra-useful. In addition to wild rides like this talk, you’ll get hands-on experience with the latest technologies and tools as well as career-building advice from community leaders.
This conference won’t feature a bunch of high-level panels and fireside chats. When you come to DevBeat, expect to leave with all the information you need to inform the next two years of your career as a developer.
Speaking of which, when you buy your ticket , make sure to expense that bad boy — you’ll be doing more than enough learning, hacking, networking, and career development to justify it. If any questions come up, have your boss call us directly.
DHH is a partner at web-dev company 37signals. He has been working with the web with varying levels of success since 1996 in the fields of game journalism, marketing, project management, design, and development.
In July 2004, he released the framework Rails (also known as Ruby on Rails). Ruby on Rails is an open-source web framework optimized for programmer happiness and beautiful code. Hundreds of thousands of programmers around the world have built amazing applications using Rails. Some of the more famous include Twitter, Shopify, 500px, and Github.
For DevBeat, DHH will be kicking off our very first Live AMA (Ask Me Anything) session. This is a free-for-all Q&A; DHH can answer or pass on any question he chooses. The results are likely to be surprising and very interesting, to put it mildly.
Stay tuned for a bunch of DevBeat program and speaker announcements over the coming weeks, and make sure to register today! The room is filling up quickly with hackers of all kinds, so get your friends/coworkers/arch-nemeses together and get tickets while the gettin’s good.
Thanks to the following industry leaders for supporting DevBeat: Ford and Pivotal as Platinum Partners; IBM as Gold Partner; and PayPal as Silver Partner.
