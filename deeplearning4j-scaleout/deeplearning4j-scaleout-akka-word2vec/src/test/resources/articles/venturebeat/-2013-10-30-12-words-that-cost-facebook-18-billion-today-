Everything was going so well. Revenue was up . Profit was up. Users were up . The stock was up.
Then Facebook CFO David Ebersman said that the social network was seeing a slight decrease in usage by younger teens on the company’s earnings call. And the stock slid from $57.10 all the way down to $47.40, wiping out billions in stock market valuation:
These 12 words just cost Facebook $18 billion of value: “We did see a decrease in daily users specifically among younger teens.” $FB

Oops.
Ebersman did qualify that the data was of “dubious significance,” since the social network knows that younger users — especially those under 13 — lie about their age to get on the network sooner, and have done so for years. But admitting it on an earnings call, though probably smart from a legal and financial standpoint, was a disaster — at least temporarily — from a valuation point of view.
“We remain close to fully penetrated among teens in the US,” Ebersman added, but the damage was done.
