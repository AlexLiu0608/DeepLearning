Two! Hundred! Fifty! Million!!!
And a $4 billion valuation.
That’s what good ol’ Spotify’s been up to today. We saw lots of other deals, but we kinda feel bad for any company that planned to announce their own sweet fundraise today. On this day, Spotify is the whale, and everyone else is a mere minnow.
Except here, in this democratic corner of the web called Funding Daily, where we present roughly the same number of words on every funding story, regardless of how large or small the deal.
Let’s get on with it!
Spotify gets $250M
Spotify just raised a lot of money — $250 million, to be more precise. That means it’s nearly doubled the total amount of funding the company has raised prior to the new round to a whopping $533 million. The new round also bumps Spotify’s estimated valuation to north of $4 billion. And while Spotify is firmly focused on growth and maintaining a varied library of songs, the company has also been adding new features to the service, building its advertising model for the free ad-supported version of the service, and cultivating its own application platform that enables developers build music services on top of Spotify.

The Hunt tracks down $5.5M
Here’s how the app works: You take a picture of some poor passerby on the street or snag an image from the Internet and demand from other Internet-using super-shoppers details on the product in question and how you can get it. Alternatively, you can look at someone else’s uploaded pictures and be all like, “Oh, yeah, you can get that at Neiman’s or 7-11 or whatever, here’s a link.” One of the spokespersons for the app is quoted as saying, “It’s like hanging in the fitting room with your close friends.” Read the full, bizarre story on VentureBeat .
