Google Now is getting smarter, more conversational, and more Siri-like.
For the first time, Google has designed Google Now so that it asks users for clarification when their queries are too vague. The update, which is a part of the latest version of Google Search for Android, was first spotted by Ars Technica .
To use the most obvious use case, if you tell Google Now to send a text message, the app will reply by asking whom you want to send the message to, and then ask for the content of the message.
This is a big turnaround from the previous process, which required users to get the full query right from the get-go.
In other words, Google Search is getting more contextual and conversational — just like Siri. It’s a subtle shift by itself, but it’s hugely significant to Google’s vision for the future of search —  which is smarter, question-based, and more human.
Right now, the Google Now update is only available for Android, but you can expect it to make it to iOS before long.
