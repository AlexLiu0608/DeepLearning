Yahoo has lured away gadget columnist David Pogue from his 13-year post at The New York Times to lead a new push into consumer technology coverage.
Yahoo chief exec Marissa Mayer announced the news today via a company blog post . In his new role at the company, Pogue will continue writing tech columns as well as news articles and video segments.
Here’s what Mayer had to say about Pogue’s new role and its push into consumer tech news:
Yahoo is in a unique position to bring to life great editorial about the technology consumers are using every day. David is tremendously talented, has a great sense of humor, and is gifted at explaining technology. He also just happens to be one of the nicest and most positive people I’ve met. He has always been one of my favorite journalists, and I can’t think of a better person to make technology more accessible and helpful for the hundreds of millions of people who come to Yahoo every day.
Yes, it’s true: After 13 years, I’m leaving the NY Times to start a new tech site (and much more) at Yahoo. pogueman.tumblr.com —

There’s some indication that Pogue’s work at Yahoo will go well beyond just a new consumer tech news site.
“Actually, ‘site’ doesn’t even cover it. I’ll be writing columns and blog posts each week, of course, and making my goofy videos,” The former NYT columnist said via his own blog . “But my team and I have much bigger plans, too, for all kinds of online and real-world creations.”
We know that part of Yahoo’s big plan to overhaul the company involves a push into media — specifically video due to the potential to generate high revenue from video ads. So I’d suspect Pogue will be doing quite a bit of video coverage in the future, which could even outweigh the amount of writing he does.
