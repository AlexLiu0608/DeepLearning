Google Glass is starting to get more useful. You can now look up public transit directions using Google’s digital eyewear.
The company announced the new functionality in a blog post today saying that you can access this information where the existing directions for car travel are. In order to access it, you can say, “OK, Glass, get directions to” and it will open up the directions “app.” At first, it will use the directions type that you used last. For example, if you searched directions by car, it will give you directions to this new location as if you’re driving by car.
In order to get to the public transit information, you need to tap the “directions card” and then swipe to to the public transit option.
Google has public transit data for cities on almost every continent and almost every major European and North American metro area.
Google has been getting more serious about its maps and the data it has on hand. The company recently acquired Waze, a free navigation app that informs you about traffic issues in the area by getting real-time information from its users.
Glass got a few smaller updates as well. You can now click through links that you might find in an e-mail, tweet, text, or other form of communication. It’ll take you two clicks to actually get through the link. First, you have to click on the “card” or the message content you’re viewing, and then you select “view site.” Glass will also now display profile pictures of people you are messaging.
