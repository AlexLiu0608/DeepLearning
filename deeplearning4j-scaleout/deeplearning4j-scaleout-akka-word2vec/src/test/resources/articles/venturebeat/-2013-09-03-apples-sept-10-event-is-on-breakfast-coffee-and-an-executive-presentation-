The long-rumored September 10 Apple Event is on — Apple just sent out press invitations. And it sounds like Apple has good news, right from CEO Tim Cook’s mouth.
Here’s the full text:
This should brighten everyone’s day.
Please join us for a café breakfast and coffee bar on September 10 at 9:00 AM followed by an executive presentation at 10:00 AM.
This invitation-only event will be held in Town Hall at 4 Infinite Loop in Cupertino.
Apple always chooses its invitation titles very, very carefully.
The fact that this one says “this should brighten everyone’s day” is a pretty clear admission that lately, the news from Cupertino has not been so bright. With Android’s global dominance and Windows Phone’s continuing rise, the news cycle for Apple has been more doom and gloom than any time since its “beleaguered” days of the pre-Steve Jobs 1990s.
The challenge is now on for Apple.
Apple needs an answer for Android’s global dominance in price-sensitive emerging markets. Apple needs an answer to Google’s wearable tech early adopter lead currently being showcased by Google Glass. Apple needs an answer to those who want an iPhone, but not just a white one or a black one . Apple needs an answer to those who think that tomorrow’s market share matters more than today’s profits . Apple needs an answer to the question of whether the company can continue to stay relevant and remain a leader without the legendary technology and business genius of Steve Jobs .
More than anything, Apple needs that next new product that we didn’t know we needed until Apple made us look at what was right in front of our eyes all the time.
September 10 will be an opportunity for Tim Cook to showcase that innovation is not dying at Apple, that the company can continue to lead the technology industry in the post-PC world. And that he can lead the company that wants to lead the future.
Apple says it’s going to get brighter. We wait with baited breath.
Will September 10 end with “oh, and one more thing?”
