Trinity Pharma makes cloud-based data, analytics, and mobile products for handling the wealth of information generated by life scientists around the world.
Today, the company announced it’s raised $15 million in a growth round. The fresh cheddar will enable Trinity to build new offices in New Jersey and California, to do more sales and marketing, and to continue development on its mobile data analytics product, AgileM.
The round was led by Health Enterprise Partners (HEP), a New York-based growth equity firm with a special focus on health care services and information technology companies.
“Over the last 12 years, Trinity has built a proven business and technology that is solving the increasingly complex challenges that life sciences and healthcare companies face worldwide,” said David Tamburri, HEP’s general partner, who will also take a seat on the Trinity board, in a statement on the news.
“The rapid change in health care requires real-time analytics to provide value beyond counting pills and with the potential to improve patient outcomes. With a seasoned management team, led by co-founder and CEO Zackary King, we see tremendous opportunity to accelerate Trinity’s growth in support of demand for its cloud-based software,” Tamburri said.
Trinity Pharma was founded in 2004 and is headquartered in Waltham, Mass. This is the company’s first round of institutional funding.
