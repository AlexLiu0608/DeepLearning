DataRPM’s platform empowers any enterprise to embed patent-pending       computational search technology and natural language analytics into any       software application
FAIRFAX, Va.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–November 14, 2013–
DataRPM, the industry pioneer in natural language and computational       search-based Business Intelligence (BI) platform for Big Data       analysis, today announced an $800,000 investment from 20K Industries,       CIT GAP Funds and other angel investors.
DataRPM will use the funding to continue building a global sales and       marketing team, to accelerate product development and to expand its       customer support team.
DataRPM offers the next generation business intelligence platform that       enables customers to connect to any data source, ask questions in       natural language and get insights from their data, without requiring       learning complex software interfaces. This feature-rich analytics       solution is available in the cloud or on-premise. DataRPM’s customers       use the solution for internal management and offer it externally to       their own customers by embedding into their software applications,       websites, blogs or intranets. The DataRPM solution is implemented       quickly and at a fraction of the cost of traditional BI implementations.       DataRPM’s groundbreaking computational search technology enables users       to mash up data from different sources for real time ad hoc analysis       with the ability to type or speak a question on a Google-like search       bar. DataRPM’s solution aims to solve the problems of big data by       creating a very simple and natural way for anyone to analyze and       visualize data on big data platforms like Hadoop, relational databases,       social web or other 3rd party systems without being a       technology or BI expert.
“Business users need an easy way to get answers from their data sets.       DataRPM’s integration of a natural language interface with search-based       technology establishes a new standard for ease-of-use and scalability,”       said Sundeep Sanghavi, co-founder & CEO of DataRPM. “Our mission is to       simplify BI and make it pervasive to provide actionable insights to       anyone throughout an organization.” DataRPM’s customers include Avectra,       MCWE, MicroPact, 3Pillar Global, Transaction Network Services (TNS)       among others.
“We see an opportunity for DataRPM to leapfrog established business       intelligence and analytics vendors,” said Haresh Bhungalia, Partner at       20K Industries. “This is a strategic investment for us, and we look       forward to DataRPM’s continued success.”
“With Big Data clusters being implemented, the market needs BI solutions       that can quickly and easily analyze vast data sets and then deliver       actionable results to managers via easy-to-use visualizations. We like       the way DataRPM addresses this market need,” said Tom Weithman, Vice       President of CIT Entrepreneur and Managing Director of the CIT GAP Funds.
