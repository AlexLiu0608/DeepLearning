While wireless charging has been around for a while now, it has yet to take off in any major way. Sony, however, might just change that.
The company is working on a new device that uses twice the electricity of previous devices, allowing it to charge in just an hour, as Nikkei reports . More, the new charging tech will be  Qi standards-compliant , meaning that not only will it be quick, but it will also be wireless.
The science behind the developments is fairly straightforward: Sony’s devices will use 10-15 watts of power, which is two to three times the maximum usage of most smartphones today.
But while pumping that much power into your current phone would in all likelihood destroy it, Sony’s charging advances will be joined by new control chips that minimize the amount of excess heat the charging generates.
Translation: Tech companies want your phone to have a better battery just as much as you do.
