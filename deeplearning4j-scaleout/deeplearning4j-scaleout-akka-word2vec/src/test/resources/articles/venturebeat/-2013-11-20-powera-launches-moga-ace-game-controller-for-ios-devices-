PowerA is launching its Moga Ace Power game controller for iOS devices today. The controller is one of many that aim to turn your mobile device into a gaming machine with console-like controls.
The market for smartphone and tablet add-ons has become a big one, and gaming is one of the biggest areas for accessories. Woodinville, Wash.-based PowerA has been trotting out a steady number of controllers for mobile devices, but this is its first foray into the Apple game controller market. The timing matches that of a rival controller, the Logitech PowerShell, which is also debuting today.
Both controllers are taking advantage of iOS 7′s support for MFI-certified controllers. The Moga Ace Power will work with a large library of games on the app store. You can drop the iOS device into the middle slot and lock it in place. The Moga Ace Power collapses together when you don’t have a device in the slot. It connects via the Lightning connector and it has dual-analog sticks, L1/R1 and L2/R2 shoulder buttons, a D-pad, and four-action buttons.
It matches the exact controls you have in a console game, whereas the Logitech device does not have analog sticks. You can also charge your iOS device when using it with the Moga Ace Power, which has a 1800 milliamp battery. That lets you play for longer sessions.
“MOGA controllers were built for real gaming by real gamers,” said Eric Bensussen, president and cofounder of PowerA. “We’re excited to deliver Moga Ace Power to iPhone and iPod touch users in time for the holidays and have them experience the precision, console-style controls that promise to revolutionize the gaming experience on these devices.”
The device sells for $99.99 at Apple stores or Moga’s web site.
