Apple just unveiled the stunning new thinner, lighter, and faster iPad Air , and already someone’s grabbed the 1080p video version of its three-minute commercial starring design guru Jony Ive.
That someone is Tanner Marsh of “ iCrackUriDevice ,” or I crack your iDevice, and here it is:
“This is the thinnest, lightest, and most powerful iPad we’ve ever delivered,” Apple design guru Jony Ive says.
iPad Air has the same 9.7-inch display as previous models, but a 43 percent smaller bezel, and 20 percent less thickness. It also now weights just one pound, and comes with Apple’s new 64-bit A7 chip, improved cameras, and the same 10-hour battery life.
At some point, surely, Apple is going to have to switch up the typical Jony Ive infomercial. The style is getting a bit old, and the grizzled earnest-ness is getting regularly spoofed.
And, contrary to the video, the iPad Air does not actually float.
