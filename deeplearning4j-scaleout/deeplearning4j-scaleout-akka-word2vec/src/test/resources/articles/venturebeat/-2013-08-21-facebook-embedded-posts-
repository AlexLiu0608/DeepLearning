Bloggers and website owners everywhere are now able to embed public Facebook posts directly on their sites. The social network pushed out the recently announced feature to everyone today.
Embedded posts means publishers can use Facebook content that has been pre-formatted to look like a Facebook post, complete with links back to the site. It’s a helpful addition for those who are referencing something that happened on Facebook and want to do more than just rephrase or post a screenshot.
Facebook originally announced the feature in late July. At the time, it was only available on CNN, the Huffington Post, Bleacher Reporter, People, and Mashable.
You can access the embed tool from the down arrow in the upper right-hand corner of a Facebook post. A window will pop up with the embed code. All you have to do is insert it into the correct area on your website and you’re done.
You won’t be able to see the full text of the post if it’s over 150 words, however. Facebook funnels the traffic back to its website by forcing you to click through to see longer content. Anyone who wants to interact with the content will also have to travel back to the original post. Comments are not supported in embeds.
Visitors will, however, be able to like the page that the post comes from. And if it wasn’t posted by a brand, visitors can follow an individual without having to leave the website they’re on.
The move might look like an attempt to take on Twitter as a major source of breaking news. Twitter has offered embedded tweets for some time as its content is often referenced in news reports.
