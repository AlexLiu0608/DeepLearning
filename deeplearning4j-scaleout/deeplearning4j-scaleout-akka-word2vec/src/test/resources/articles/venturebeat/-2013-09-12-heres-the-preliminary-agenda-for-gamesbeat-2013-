Asia’s Growing Influence on the US Games Industry
The games market is undergoing a massive change as platforms continue to converge, and the free-to-play business model is gaining momentum in the West. Yet Nexon – the global company that pioneered F2P over 15 years ago, which generated more than $1.3 billion in revenues and operating margins of over 40 percent in 2012 – has become a quiet giant, but it isn’t well known in the U.S. Nexon CFO Owen Mahoney will discuss the new realities of the U.S. gaming industry, strategies to succeed in the West and how Nexon plans to disrupt the console status quo.

Signs of Maturity in Mobile Gaming
5+ years after its launch, the app store has become a rational place to build a gaming business. One sign of maturity? Market leaders like Rovio rely on traditional marketing strategies and multi-million dollar budgets to build long term franchises. There are still plenty of opportunities for indie game developers to make it big, but they now need to be smarter marketers and business strategists to compete to win. Simon Khalaf will discuss signs of maturity in mobile gaming, look at what the big mobile franchises have done right, and pinpoint what small developers can learn from the Rovios and Imangis of the world when it comes to marketing for long term success even without a studio-sized budget.
