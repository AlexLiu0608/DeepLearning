The fate of Fisker Automotive has been hanging for months, but now an offer for the company has been “signed” and is “on the table.”
At least that’s the word from Ingo Voigt, who, along with Fritz Nol, is one of a pair of German investors who want to buy the company.
“I am proud to tell you that we just sent our detailed offer including a signed LOI and short presentation of our restructing plan to the DoE on fax and mail,” says a post by Voight yesterday on Facebook.
“Now it’s time to pray!” he concludes.
“LOI” refers to “letter of intent,” the official document offering to buy the company.
The purchase goes to the U.S. Department of Energy because the government agency loaned roughly $193 million to Fisker that the company has not paid back.
Disbursements on the loan were suspended early in 2011 , but the DoE’s loan terms give it a say in the ultimate disposition of the company.
As reported last month in the German AutoBild , the Fritz Nol group was said to be interested in acquiring Fisker for a mere $25 million .
The German group reportedly planned to relocate production of the Karma range-extended electric luxury sedan from from independent Finnish manufacturer Valmet to the U.S.
One likely site might be the factory in Wilmington, Delaware, that Fisker bought to build its so-far stillborn second model, the Atlantic .
There may be other bidders for the remains of Fisker as well. Bob Lutz, whose VL Automotive concern previewed a V-8-powered Karma called the Destino, put in a bid back in May .
Original cofounder Henrik Fisker also discussed making an offer , backed by a Hong Kong-based investor group. In March of this year, Fisker had left the company in a disagreement over strategic direction with CEO Tony Posawatz.
Fisker stopped assembling its Karma range-extended electric luxury sport sedan in July 2012, after more than 2,000 had been built.
