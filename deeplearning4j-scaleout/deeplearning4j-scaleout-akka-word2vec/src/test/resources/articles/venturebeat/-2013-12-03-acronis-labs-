Data backup and protection firm Acronis is launching an official research and development wing.
The company today announced the formation of Acronis Labs, a research initiative split between its Arlington, VA and Moscow, Russia offices that will further develop Acronis’ cloud, data, and mobility technologies. Acronis is initially allocating $10 million for the Labs, some of which will go toward new developer hires.
“Acronis Labs is the place to be if you want to create new ways of dealing with data storage,” said Acronis CEO Serguei Beloussov in a statement.

Founded in 2002, Acronis originally focused on disk partitioning and boot loader software, but soon moved into backup and disaster recovery services targeted at consumers and small to medium sized enterprises. It also offers a mobile device management solution bolstered by its Sept. 2012 acquisition of GroupLogic, which specialized in enterprise file-sharing in mobile environments.
Acronis competes with firms like Symantec and Commvault in the backup and recovery space (though Commvault targets larger businesses than Acronis, noted Beloussov). The company has never raised outside investment because it became profitable in the second quarter of its existence, Beloussov told VentureBeat.
But it hasn’t always been easy. Beloussov left Acronis years ago to focus on his partner role at Runa Capital, but was displeased with the company’s direction and stagnating growth, so he returned this past May to rectify the “turbulent circumstances.”
“For a company in a steady state, internally and externally, it is quite easy to be managed by professional management,” said Beloussov in a recent interview with VentureBeat. “When a company is in turbulence, it’s much harder — you need to do with your own hands.”
Max Lyadvinsky, Acronis’ vice president of engineering, will lead the Acronis Labs team. In addition to working on new products and features, Acronis Labs aims to strengthen the company’s patent portfolio.
