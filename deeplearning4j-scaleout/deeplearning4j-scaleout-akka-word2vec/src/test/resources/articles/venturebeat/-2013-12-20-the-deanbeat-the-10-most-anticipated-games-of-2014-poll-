I sat down to come up with this list of the top 10 games of 2014. Then I cheated. Since I couldn’t decide what to cut, I expanded the list to 13, and then I shrank it down again. Like many gamers, I agonize over which games I’d like to play the most. Now I feel pretty good about this list, which reflects my natural biases as a gamer. I favor new intellectual property, intense drama, spectacular shooters, cinematic moments, strong stories, great characters, and something fresh. But occasionally, plain and simple fun and humor will trump all of those things.
That explains why Mario Kart 8 is on the list. I’m happy to see variety across the platforms and that no single company is going to have a monopoly on fun. I wish that I knew more about what is coming, but after the next-generation game console launches, it seems like there are a lot fewer firm dates for the 2014 game launches. I would to see more mobile games on this list and more indie games too. But I have a lot less visibility into those sectors as those launches don’t involve months-long pre-launch marketing campaigns. I hope there are a lot of surprises still to come.
Here are my most anticipated games in order, with my favorite at No. 1. And for the sake of comparison, here’s last year’s list of the most anticipated games of 2013 , and the year before that for the most anticipated games of 2012 . I’m sure there will be a Call of Duty shooter game that gets announced during the year, but it isn’t announced yet, so I haven’t included it.
For the record, I would put The Last Guardian on this list, but that would only extend its curse as one of the longest-gestation games in recent memory. The game coming from Sony’s Team Ico, the maker of Shadow of the Colossus, was on our list for the most anticipated games of 2012. I have no clue what this game is about, and I have no idea when it will arrive. I also have almost no confidence it will be soon.
I’d definitely like to see more about No Man’s Sky, Project Spark, and Fantasia: Music Evolved as well. They were on my short list, but were not on the final cut. It’s going to be another exciting year in games.
