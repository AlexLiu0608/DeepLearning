While everyone in Silicon Valley is talking about the power of Big Data, the number of people who actually understand how to harness Big Data — so-called “data scientists” — is exceedingly small.
That’s a problem, of course, because companies can’t find enough of these data scientists to hire.

I’m proud to say that we have many of the leading lights of data science attending our DataBeat event next week in Redwood City. If you’re looking to use Big Data to get ahead in your business, you need to be there. There are only a few spots left, so make sure to get your tickets !
Take a look at our speaker list , and you’ll see that we have the Who’s Who of data science attending. The agenda is jam-packed with the best in the field.
Here are some of the highlights.
In our “Rat Pack Comes Back” session, pioneers of this field will talk about how the industry is changing. Some of them even helped coin the term data science. These are folks like:
* Pete Warden, the former Apple engineer and founder of OpenHeatMap and expert on visualization ( see what he’s done on Facebook data , for example)
* Monica Rogati, VP of Data, Jawbone, which is tracking massive amounts of personal data to help you lead a better life
* Peter Skomoroch, former Principal Data Scientist at LinkedIn
* Jeremy Howard, who hold’s the top spot on the competitor rankings of 20,000 data scientists
Also speaking will be Josh James, the creator of Omniture, one of the world’s leading Web analytics companies, which he sold to Adobe for $1.8 billion in 2009. Thanks to Omniture, Adobe now tracks 72 percent of all online retail spend .  James is now working on a new project called Domo, and he’ll talk about how CEOs need to work from a dashboard that can track data from across their entire organization.
Another session will feature a blitz tutorial on the top ten most important big data tools in the market, from Python to SaS.
In another, we’ll feature the industry’s leading venture capitalists, who will point to where data analysis is driving the most disruption, and thus opening the most opportunity. Famous investor Vinod Khosla will elaborate in more detail about how Big Data is driving change in health .
We’ll hear directly from companies like General Electric, LinkedIn and Intuit, about how they’re applying the secrets of big data to transform their businesses. And we’ll have mind-blowing sessions from the likes of Jason Fass of Zepp Labs and Tarek Kamil of InfoMotion Sports Technologies, which you won’t want to miss.
Data scientists are at the top of the Silicon Valley pyramid right now. They’re there for a reason, because few people have the skills to qualify: Data scientists know how to use Big Data tools such as Hadoop. They tend to also be programmers, and have strong math skills, in that they are masters of statistics. They grok data visualization too. And finally, they need to have a strong understanding of the business.
All of this — the heat and light surrounding Big Data, the star-studded lineup of speakers we’ve got — is why I’m so excited about DataBeat this year. We’ve designed it to host the best data scientists in the world, and in addition to the speakers, we expect hundreds more data scientists to be in attendance. One reason we’ve been able to do this is because we partnered this year with the folks behind the Data Science Summit , which has been nurturing the data science community for the past three years.
Grab your tickets now! There are only a few seats left. Understanding Big Data promises will give your company huge advantages, and there’s no better place to learn about it than at the feet of these data science luminaries. See you there!
