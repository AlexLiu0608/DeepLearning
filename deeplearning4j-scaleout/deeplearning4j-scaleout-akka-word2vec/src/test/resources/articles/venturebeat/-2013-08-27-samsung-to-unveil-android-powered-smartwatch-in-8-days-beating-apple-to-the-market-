Which means the Samsung rumors were true , at least.
Samsung’s executive vice president for mobile, Lee Young-hee, announced the impending launch in an  interview with KoreaTimes  today. The new Samsung smartwatch will be called the Galaxy Gear, putting it under the same brand label of Samsung’s top-selling smartphones and tablets. It will not have a flexible display, but will “enhance and enrich the current smart mobile experience in many ways,” Young-Lee said.
If that’s the case, the Samsung smartwatch likely fits into the dashboard or console category of smartwatch , not the the multi-function category. Dashboard-style smartwatches are mainly more-accessible screens for alerts and notifications from connected devices such as smartphones, while multi-function smartwatches often include sensors and capability to measure health and fitness activity, among other things.
Which means that Apple may still have a wide-open niche to fill with iWatch.
Apple CEO Tim Cook was recently spurred to speed up by Apple’s board , after pre-announcing almost six months of no new Apple product launches back in April of this year. As a result of that excess of deliberation, the company’s international sales have drooped , its global iPhone market share is sliding , and its once-unassailable tablet lead has been chopped in half .
Apple is rumored to be announcing a new product in September, perhaps on the tenth. That, most likely, will be the company’s new iPhone 5S and the colorful, cheaper iPhone 5C . But it’s possible that Apple is preparing a massive, integrated unveiling of many new products, a la the  October 23 Apple Event last year .
If so, there’s an outside chance we could see the iWatch unveiled right after the Galaxy Gear.
A Juniper Research report, coincidentally released just this morning, suggests that Samsung and Apple’s entrance into the smartwatch market will boost device adoption to 36 million by 2018 . But that will only happen if Apple does indeed release a smartwatch product alongside Samsung’s new Gear.
Tech evangelist Robert Scoble is pretty sure Apple will, and that it will be a hit.
“It’s going to be geek jewelry, and normal people are going to want it because it’s probably going to be very beautiful looking, and it will be a new thing to show off, and I now have a new display for my mobile phone,” he told me last week.
While Samsung has not provided more details, the Gear likely sports a 2.5″ display, uses Bluetooth to communicate to Samsung smartphones, and may have NFC for syncing and authentication. Interestingly, the watch will likely sync with a Samsung app that is not available from Google Play but instead must be downloaded from Samsung’s own app store.
Which would make this smartwatch yet another attempt by Samsung — along with Tizen, its own smartphone operating system — to ween itself from Google and Google Play.
