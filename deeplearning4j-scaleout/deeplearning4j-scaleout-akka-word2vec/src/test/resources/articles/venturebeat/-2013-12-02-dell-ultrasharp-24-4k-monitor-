It might be time for that LASIK eye surgery: Dell’s about to jam a whole mess of pixels really, really close together.
The U.S. hardware maker recently leaked details on its new 24-inch, 4K monitor: the Dell UltraSharp 24 Monitor (UP2414Q) . Spotted on Friday by BSN and other news outlets, the LED monitor features a 3,840 x 2,160 resolution display — a 185 pixel per inch (PPI) density — with nearly half the total surface area of 32-inch “Ultra HD” monitors from Dell, Sharp, Asus, and others.
The UltraSharp 24 boasts the highest pixel density in a Dell monitor yet, according to the hardware maker, but it’s not the highest on the market: IBM’s T220 and T221 monitors sport an insane 204 PPI, for example. But the little UltraSharp boasts some impressive specs beyond its resolution:
A 178º vertical / 178º horizontal viewing angle
1.07 billion colors (produced by an 8-bit panel with Advanced Frame Rate Control)
99% AdobeRGB and 100% sRGB color coverage
2-million-to-one maximum dynamic contrast ratio
HDMI, DisplayPort, mini-DP, four USB 3.0 ports, and six-in-one card reader
Additionally, the panel weighs in at just over 10 pounds and is made with more than 25 percent recycled plastics.
Dell has yet to reveal a price tag or launch date for its UltraSharp 24 monitor, but we’ve reached out to the company for details and will be sure to keep you posted as we learn more. For context, Dell’s 32″ UltraSharp monitor costs $3,500.
