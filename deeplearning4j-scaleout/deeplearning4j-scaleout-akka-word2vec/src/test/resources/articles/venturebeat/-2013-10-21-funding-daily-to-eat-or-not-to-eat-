Today’s funding roundup brings two interesting views on food consumption.
First, there’s a deal for Soylent, which is basically a foodie’s nightmare and reminds us all to much of the crap from The Matrix. Sure, it could save humanity, but it’s, like, gross.
Then, there’s Treatsie, yet another subscription commerce startup that brings “artisanal” candy to your gingerbread door, you creepy, child-eating witch, you. Or you could just have a sweet tooth. Whatever.
Of course, there were a bunch of other deals today, too, namely:

Panorama closes $4M round
When Aaron Feuer was in high school, he helped write a bill for students to give feedback on their classes. He couldn’t shake the feeling that the bill wasn’t enough. So he began building Panorama Education, which works with school districts to gather the requisite data they needed to improve education. Today, at the age of 22, Feuer closed $4 million in funding from Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg’s $100 million fund, Startup: Education. Read the full story on VentureBeat .

Superpedestrian launches with $2.1M
In another stunning case of life mimicking fiction, this startup birthed into vivid reality the product of Andy from Weeds: an electric bike powered by its own kinetic energy.

This seed financing will help the company scale out its manufacturing and improve the product. Read more on VentureBeat .
