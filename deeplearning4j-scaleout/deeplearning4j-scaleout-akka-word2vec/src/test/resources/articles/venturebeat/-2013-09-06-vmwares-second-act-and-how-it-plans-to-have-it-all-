VMware rocked the enterprise world over the past decade. It gained a convincing lock on large businesses by serving them virtualization technology.
Now valued at about $37 billion, the 15-year-old VMware isn’t satisfied with its dominance of the enterprise data centers. It wants to help all those enterprise customers use public cloud infrastructure, too: by offering some of its own.
Dedicated VMware customers should want this. What’s not to like about being able to access their virtualized servers both in the data center as well as out in the cloud – seamlessly through one provide like VMware?
This hybrid approach enables companies to manage their workloads more cost-effectively, shifting back and forth between their more controlled environments and the cloud when they need that extra capacity.
VMware’s announced last week that its vCloud Hybrid goes live to U.S. customers this month from VMware data centers in California, Virginia, and Nevada.
At CloudBeat 2013 , which starts Monday, we’ve invited real customers of VMware’s hybrid cloud, Bechtel’s Christian Reilly and Digital River’s CIO Christopher Rence, to join us onstage to tell us about this hybrid VMware experience. They’ve been using the hybrid offering since it was available through an early testing program since May. They’ll be joined on stage by VMware VP of cloud services Matthew Lodge.
(It’s all happening Sept. 9-Sept. 10 at the Grand Hyatt in San Francisco.  Register today for a 20 percent VIP discount .)
This session comes at a time when analysts and businesses are increasingly highlighting the importance of the hybrid cloud approach . Importantly, though, they are asking whether VMware’s vCloud positions VMware adequately. Can VMware really be a decisive player in the cloud when so much of its business is in the data center, which affords higher profits to VMware. We’ve written several pieces from the company’s event last week, VMworld, about VMware’s challenges (see here , here , here ,  here , and here ).
And on Wednesday, GigaOM’s Barb Darrow was just the latest to write  an insightful piece  summarizing the challenges to VMware as it moves into this second act.
VMware has other advantages. It has big stake in the new $1 billion cloud-oriented platform as a service player, Pivotal. In fact, I’ll be talking with Pivotal’s CEO, Paul Martiz, at the CloudBeat event in a fireside chat.
At the same time, VMware faces direct attacks from Amazon and Microsoft on both fronts – the enterprise and the cloud. Both companies are offering services that threaten to undercut VMware’s offerings on price.
We look forward to hearing from Bechtel’s Christian Reilly and Digital River’s Christopher Rence about why VMware’s hybrid solution makes sense for them.
