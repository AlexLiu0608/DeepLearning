Olloclip will let you take better pictures with your iPhones and iPods with its new attachable 4-in-1 lens. It is a very cool attachment that weighs less than an ounce and turns your iOS device into a high-quality camera.

The Huntington Beach, Calif.-based company unveiled its new lens at the Pepcom holiday gift event in San Francisco last week. The small attachment clips onto your device and allows you to take photos with 10X or 15X magnification, a fish-eye lens, or a wide-angle lens. These lens enhance the appeal of the iPhone, which already has a high-quality camera in terms of its image density, for photography fans.
Olloclip goes with the iPhone 4, the iPhone 4S, and the iPhone 5. Soon the company will have one for the iPhone 5C. The Olloclip comes with an adapter that can make it work with the newest iPod Touch fifth-generation devices. Normally, you’d need a DSLR camera to be able to take photos with these kinds of lenses.
The company previously created a three-in-one lens for $70. Apple sells the Olloclip products in its Apple retail stores. Now the 4-in-1 lens will replace the original product for the same price of $70.
The Olloclip lets you change the function of the lens either by turning the adapter around or by unscrewing one of the attachments on the lens. You can slide it on or off in a snap. It also has a circular polarizer lens which blocks out light coming in at user-adjustable angles, making colors come to life and reducing reflections.
The Olloclip was created by Patrick O’Neill and his designer, Chong Pak, a couple of years ago. Pew Research recently reported that 82 percent of smartphone owners are using their phones to take pictures.
