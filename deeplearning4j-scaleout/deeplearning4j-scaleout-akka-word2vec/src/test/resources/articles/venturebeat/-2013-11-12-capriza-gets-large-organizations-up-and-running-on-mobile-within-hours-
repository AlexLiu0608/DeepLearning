People just don’t do business like they used to. Now they have mobile phones.
Capriza makes it significantly easier for employees to access web-based business applications on their phones without requiring any coding, integrations, or APIs.
“We are trying to close the gap on a major transition in the industry toward bring-your-own-device (BYOD),” CEO and cofounder Yuval Scarlat said in an interview. “People would like access to information related to work on their smartphones, but those systems are not designed to be accessed from these devices.”
Capriza’s platform simplifies existing web applications into “Zapps,” or lightweight, mobile-optimized versions of the originals. You quickly pick and choose the elements you need from your desktop workflow, and voilà — you have an HTML5 app that’s ready to deploy in hours.
Capriza claims to be 10 times faster than any other platform
Native mobile applications take time, money, and resources to create. Capriza’s technology basically helps businesses bypass those hurdles while still extending their systems to employees on mobile. Each department and/or employee can adjust the Zapps to their particular needs.
“The way people interact with mobile devices is completely different from traditional enterprise systems,” Scarlat said. “Everything from behavior to form factor to the computing platform has changed. Capriza takes the most useful business tasks that people do, pulls these snippets of interactions, and translates that onto mobile.”
Capriza operates on a subscription model, and it costs a fraction of what it takes to develop a traditional app (or so it claims).
You can share Zapps with teams, departments, and entire organizations, and customizable dashboards display feedback, monitor deployment and usage statistics, and manage who gets access to what.
“Organizations know they need to be on mobile, but it is a headache to make that transition,” Scarlat said. “We come with them saying we can help them make that transition an order of magnitude faster and at a lower cost.”
Scarlat and fellow founders Oren Ariel, Ronnen Armon, and Amnon Landan previously started Mercury Interactive, which HP acquired in 2006 for $4.9 billion. Mercury provided business technology optimization software and services.
The Israeli team formed Capriza in 2011 and raised $10.5 million from Andreessen Horowitz while still in stealth mode.
It is working with a number of large enterprise clients, such as T-Mobile, and is working with big business app vendors like SAP, Oracle, and Salesforce to bring the product to market. Capriza won VentureBeat’s mobile innovation showdown earlier this year.
