SAN FRANCISCO — New Relic has been on a roll with shipping products, snatching up funding, and gaining customers. What’s next?
Amid a flurry of news and announcements leading up to FutureStack, the company’s first developer conference, we got to sit down with CEO Lew Cirne — and of course, we couldn’t not ask about the possibility of an IPO.
High level but hands-on
Our upcoming DevBeat conference , Nov. 12-13 in San Francisco, will have a lot more on this topic. Featuring hacker legends like Stallman, DHH, Rasmus Lerdorf, and Alex Payne, it’s a hands-on developer event packed with:
workshops
live Ask-Me-Anything
hardware hacking
It’s all aimed at boosting your code skills, security knowledge, hardware hacking, and career development. Register now.
“The only thing I can imagine as the next big event for the company is a public offering,” he said, carefully avoiding any mention of an exact timeline.
“This company has immense opportunity,” he continued. “It depends heavily on how well we break out of APM [application performance management]. An APM company can be a billion-dollar business, but we want to break out of that in the long term.”
A lot of that has to do with today’s announcements around Rubicon, a fascinating new business-focused database and UI. Cirne said he sees Rubicon as giving business people the same power that the APM products give to developers: deep, specific knowledge about how their creations and ideas are flying in the real world, in real time.
That, said Cirne, is the ultimate big-data play.
“If we pull [Rubicon] off … we can do for meta-databases what Oracle did for databases.”
Cirne revealed that without including Rubicon projections, New Relic will achieve $100 million in SaaS revenues for 2014, and the business is expected to double for 2013.
He concluded, “My goal is for New Relic to outlast me, to go for decades and decades and be a top enterprise company.”
