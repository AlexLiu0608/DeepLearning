TRAINR recognizes that every move matters™. While most fitness       monitoring devices track only cardiovascular exercise (steps and       stairs), TRAINR targets users practicing resistance and body weight       training by providing top-trainer designed workouts tailored to the       user. Further, TRAINR’s proprietary software and algorithm, coupled with       the motion sensors of a wrist-worn smart device, automatically identify,       track and record the user’s exact movements as they exercise-recording       repetitions, sets and rest periods. Leveraging this data, TRAINR       empowers users with real-time feedback and provides targeted workouts       developed by professional trainers.
“TRAINR is leading fitness software innovation for quantified-self       wearables in an ecosystem on the cusp of explosive growth,” said Cavan       Canavan, CEO and co-founder. “Our flagship product TRAINR unlocks the       potential of a fitness monitoring device to serve as a personal trainer       by providing guided workouts whether users are at home or on the go. No       other product on the market does what TRAINR can and we’re proud to be       able to enrich the experience users have with their wearables, starting       with the Galaxy Gear.”
TRAINR launches first for the Galaxy Gear as a trial download in the       Samsung Apps store with planned future versions for other wearables in       the market. The launch version is free while premium-version       subscription details and pricing are to be announced. TRAINR is       compatible with Galaxy Gear and Galaxy Note 3, as well as Galaxy S3 and       S4 running Android 4.3 Jelly Bean.
