Just in time for the holiday season, pop star Lady Gaga has partnered with BitTorrent, Inc., and Vice Magazine to release a special treat for her fans: behind the scenes video from her recent album, Artpop.
Available in early December, the video footage will be packaged a peer-to-peer download, or BitTorrent bundle. The bundle will include “behind the scenes” look at the pop star’s single “Do What U Want” and an interview with the 27-year-old performer ( also known as Stefani Germanotta ) conducted by Vice’s editor-in-chief, Rocco Castoro, according to a written statement on BitTorrent’s blog.
BitTorrent’s technology remains synonymous with an ongoing global copyright war , pitting the music, film, and software industry against a motley band of global pirates. The partnership between BitTorrent, a world-renown pop star, and counter-culture magazine,  is likely a part of an ongoing strategy to shed its image as enabler of digital piracy.
“It’s an uncensored look at an artist, and an album, that refuses to conform to pop music standards,” the statement noted.
The video footage is in 4K, an extremely high-resolution format that’s slowly gaining momentum as the cost of such displays falls.
A BitTorrent bundle is package of files that give content creators the option to give their work away for free—after a consumer has given their e-mail address.
It remains to be seen whether Lady Gaga’s fan base — affectionately named “Little Monsters” — will aid in rehabbing BitTorrent’s image.
BitTorrent and Vice first announced this collaboration in October, and their effort currently includes bundles featuring work  from Madonna, Moby, Epic Meal Time, and Public Enemy .
