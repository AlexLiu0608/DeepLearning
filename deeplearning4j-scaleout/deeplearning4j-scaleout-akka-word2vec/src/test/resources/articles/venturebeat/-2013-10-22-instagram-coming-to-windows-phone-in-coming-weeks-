Rest easy Windows Phone fans, you won’t have to make do with Instagram clones for much longer.
As part of the huge Nokia World media event in Abu Dhabi, Instagram revealed that its photo and video sharing app would be heading to Windows Phone soon.
“Our ultimate goal is to bring Instagram to everyone who wants to use it,” Kevin Systrom, CEO and co-founder of Instagram, said in a statement. “We’re looking forward to watching the Windows Phone community use Instagram to capture and share beautiful moments in the coming weeks.”
For the longest time, it seemed that Windows Phone would be left without an official Instagram app (Microsoft had to build its own Facebook app to get it on Windows Phone). Indeed, the lack of a proper Instagram solution was one of my last straws with Windows Phone when I reviewed the Lumia 1020 . Sure, there are other third-party Instagram offerings on Windows Phone, but as we saw this summer, Instagram could choose to disable those apps whenever it wants.
What’s really interesting about this announcement is that it’s being made together with Nokia. Perhaps Microsoft just wanted to time a big announcement with Nokia’s latest device announcements , but I wonder just how much Nokia was involved with bringing Instagram aboard. Nokia’s PureView smartphone camera technology is still the best I’ve ever seen in a smartphone, so it would make sense if Instagram wants to get in on that action.
