Facebook just reported record quarterly revenue and significant increases in daily, monthly, and mobile users. And it’s also making more money, per user, in every single territory it measures.
Monthly active users hit almost 1.2 billion, and the number of people who check Facebook by mobile on a daily basis just crossed the half-billion mark. And for all those users, Facebook is recording ad revenue .
$2.016 billion of revenue for this quarter alone.
The lion’s share of that revenue is from the U.S. and Canada, where Facebook makes almost half its money — $962 million in Q3. Europe comes second, with $538 million, and Asia comes third, at $278 million. Everything else, including Africa and Oceania, is swept up into the social network’s catchall category, “rest of world,” and accounts for $238 million.
In every case, that’s up from last quarter — and the highest of any quarter in the company’s history.
But the increased revenue is not simply a matter of an increased number of users. Instead, Facebook is also growing ad revenue per user. The U.S and Canada is up most significantly, from $3.67 to $4.19 — a 14 percent increase. And Europe is up from $1.67 to $1.76, while Asia and the rest of the world are both up smaller amounts.
Thos are significant numbers in the space of just a quarter, and they speak to a tremendous acceleration in monetization by Facebook. And Instagram has yet to be really tapped at all.
