OSX Mavericks is one step closer to hitting your Mac.
Apple has finished the OSX Golden Master and delivered it to developers on Thursday. “Golden Master” in this case means that the version of OSX developers are now using is the same one that you’re going to see when Mavericks goes on sale.
Announced at WWDC 2013 in June,  Mavericks offers features like improved battery performance, advanced multiple display support, and desktop versions of iMaps and iBooks. As with Mountain Lion before it, Apple plans to release Mavericks via digital download for $20 or so.
So when will OSX Mavericks actually be available to consumers? If previous reports are correct , it should go on sale by the end of this month, likely coinciding with Apple’s next, iPad-focused event.
