The ability to snap a photo on your phone and immediately share it with the world has created powerful new opportunities for photojournalism. It allows anyone with a smartphone to capture momentous events and tell international news stories, as seen through their eyes.
Photo-sharing app Instagram now has 150 million members and 55 million photos are uploaded everyday. Amidst the millions of teenage selfies, food photos, and snapshots of Bangkok malls, are images of what stories captured the hearts and minds of the world in 2013.
