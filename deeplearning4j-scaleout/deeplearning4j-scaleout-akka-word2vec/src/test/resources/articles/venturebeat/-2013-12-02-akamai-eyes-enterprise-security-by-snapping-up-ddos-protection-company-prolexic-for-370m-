With great troves of online content comes a great responsibility for security.
Akamai, one of the top content delivery firms on the web, announced today that it’s acquiring cloud security company Prolexic for $370 million. The deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2014, will help protect Akamai’s enterprise clients from distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks (where attackers try to flood a company’s servers with traffic).
Akamai already offers a wide variety of security services, but Prolexic gives it a solution directly targeted at DDoS attacks. Specifically, Akamai notes that the company’s technology could help to protect data centers and enterprise applications (like corporate email services) from attacks.
“Today, business is defined by the availability, security, and latency of Internet-facing applications, data, and infrastructure,” Prolexic CEO Scott Hammack said in a statement. “Being able to rely on one provider for Internet performance and security greatly simplifies resolution of network availability issues and offers clients clear lines of accountability.”
