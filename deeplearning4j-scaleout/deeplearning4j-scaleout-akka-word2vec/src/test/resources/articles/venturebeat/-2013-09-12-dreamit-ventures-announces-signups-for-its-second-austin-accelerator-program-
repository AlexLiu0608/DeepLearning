DreamIt Ventures is opening up its application process for its second accelerator program in Austin, Texas, the accelerator announced today.
DreamIt has accelerator programs in many different cities, such as Philadelphia (health tech and tech accelerator), New York, and Austin, as well as Israel. The program has thus far launched 127 companies since it began in 2008, including Adaptly, Cloudmine, Hoot.me, SCVNGR/LevelUp, SeatGeek, TrendKite, and Biomeme. It’s companies have raised over $95 million in funding combined.
The DreamIt managing partner Kerry Rupp will once again run the program , and this year she’ll also be joined by DreamIt cofounder Steve Welch, who recently relocated to Austin. The program itself will run for three months, beginning in January. DreamIt plans on accepting up to 10 companies into the Austin program, each of which will get a up to $25,000 stipend and access to services that will aid them in getting situated.
Signups for DreamIt’s accelerator are open now via AngelList  and will run until Nov. 8.
