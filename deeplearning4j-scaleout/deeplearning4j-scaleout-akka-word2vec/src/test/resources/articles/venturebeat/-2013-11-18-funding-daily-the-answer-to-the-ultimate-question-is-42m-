This provides for far faster data transfers from routers that are 21-times smaller than existing enterprise routers. Read the full story on VentureBeat

Mojave Networks grabs $5M
Mobile device management (MDM) is not equivalent to mobile security. That’s the message we heard this morning during our discussion with Garrett Larsson, the cofounder and CEO of Mojave Networks (formerly Clutch Mobile), which just raised a $5 million funding round. “MDM is often called mobile security, but at the end of the day, it’s really just configuration,” Larsson told VentureBeat. “There’s not really any security or analytics around it.” Read the full story on VentureBeat .
