That’s tough enough, likely, but then Apple goes all science fiction:
In yet another example, a propulsion system may be utilized to change a rate of rotation of the device and/or to help slow or stop impact of the device with a surface. The propulsion system may be implemented as a fan, a jet or other suitable propulsion device. The propulsion system may be implemented alone or in combination with another system for changing the angular momentum of the device and/or helping to prevent the device incurring damage.

Falling iPhone, magically changing its orientation
Fitting something like that into an already-tightly-packed iPhone which Apple is trying to make as tiny and light as possible sounds challenging in the extreme. So do other methodologies Apple lists as possible ways to cushion the phone’s fall: using an internal gas canister as a thrust source to adjust the device’s orientation, re-purposing a cooling fan to blow air to create and “air cushion” just before impact, or, yes, even using an electric ion propulsion system to slow the phone down.
That is seriously science fiction, and likely more fiction than science.
In other situations, the patent says, Apple could build in technology to grip an attached power cord to prevent a fall, and retract any exposed buttons or switches to prevent damage to them.
It’s hard to know how much to take seriously when reading a patent from a technology company, as companies tend to include everything including the kitchen sink so that their patents are as broad as possible and any technology invented in following years can ideally be traced to that patent, and therefore protected. Some of the capabilities in this patent application look like they make a lot of sense — if they can be fitted into a tiny enclosure — but some, such as jets and ion propulsion in a device that fits in your pocket, seem fantastical at best.
Here is the entire patent:
