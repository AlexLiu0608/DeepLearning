Practice Fusion , a health care technology startup, has closed another $15 million in funding, the company announced today.
Practice Fusion is well known for its free web-based electronic medical records (EMR) as well as its recently launched consumer website  called  Patient Fusion .
The new funding is actually an extension to the $70 million round of funding Practice Fusion raised back in September, making the total investment $85 million. The extension was led by Qualcomm Ventures, which makes sense given the influx of mobile devices being used both by doctors and patients in relation to health care.
Practice Fusion said it plans to use the new funding to further integrate its technology into mobile, continue its growth, and pursue potential acquisitions.
Founded in 2005, the San Francisco, Calif.-based startup has raised a total of $155 million in funding to date.
