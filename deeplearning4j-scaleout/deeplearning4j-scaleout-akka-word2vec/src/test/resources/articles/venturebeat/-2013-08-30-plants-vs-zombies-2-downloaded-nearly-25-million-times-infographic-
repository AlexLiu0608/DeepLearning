People seem to love their zombie-fighting vegetation.
Developer PopCap revealed today that gamers have downloaded strategy game Plants vs. Zombies 2: It’s About Time (see our review ) almost 25 million times. That’s after just two weeks since it launched globally for iOS devices on Aug. 15. PopCap says that’s more than the total lifetime downloads for the original Plants vs. Zombies.
Of course, the colorful sequel has a bit of an advantage when compared to its predecessor. Plants vs. Zombies 2 is free-to-play (with optional paid microtransactions) while the original debuted at $20 on PC and currently sells for $1 on iOS.
Still, 25 million is a huge number for any game after two weeks and proves the power of the Plants vs. Zombies brand. PopCap released the following infographic to illustrate just how many people are playing:
