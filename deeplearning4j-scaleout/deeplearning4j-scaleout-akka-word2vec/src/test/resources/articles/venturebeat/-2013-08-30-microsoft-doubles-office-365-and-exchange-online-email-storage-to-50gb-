Microsoft has done a lot to make Office 365 a strong value for consumers and businesses, and it recently opened up 365 access on iPhone and Android phones.
Now the email storage of Office 365 (and Exchange Online) mailboxes is getting a significant bump, doubling from 25GB to 50GB at no extra cost, Microsoft announced in a blog post . The storage increase applies to most Office 365 and Exchange Online service plans. The only plans that aren’t getting the bump are “Exchange Kiosk” and “Office 365 Kiosk.” Kiosk mailboxes, however, are also doubling from 1GB to 2GB of storage.
Office 365 is Microsoft’s subscription-based version of Office that is tied deeply to the cloud. Exchange Online gives businesses email, calendar, and contact support locally and in the cloud.

On top of doubling Exchange Online and Office 365 primary email box storage, shared business mailboxes are doubling from 5GB to 10GB.
This isn’t the only big storage upgrade Microsoft has rolled out recently. Earlier this week, the company  increased SkyDrive Pro storage from 7GB to 25GB at no extra cost.
