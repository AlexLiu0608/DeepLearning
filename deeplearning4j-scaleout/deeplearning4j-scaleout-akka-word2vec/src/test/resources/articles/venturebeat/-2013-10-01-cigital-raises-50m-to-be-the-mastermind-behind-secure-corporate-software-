Cigital has raised $50 million to help its customers design, build, and maintain secure software.
Cigital bills itself as the world’s largest consulting firm specializing in software security. The Dulles, Virginia- based company has eight patents, and offers a suite of services and products to keep organizations secure.
Products include SecureAssist, which provides “just-in-time” coding guidance to developers by identifying security bigs as code is created, and the BuildSecure eLibrary which provides training to keep teams up to date.
It works with clients across a range of industries, including government where it has its roots. Federal clients include the NSA, Department of Energy, the Department of Homeland Security, and the FDIC, and DARPA.
Cigital was founded in 1992 with funding and contracts from DARPA and NASA. It developed one of the first static analysis tools, which lets organizations monitor software performance without actually running the software.
The company now works companies in financial services, healthcare, retail and hospitality, online gaming, telecom and others to conduct assessments and create system infrastructure that is protected against threats.
Security is extremely important for organizations of all sizes. Breaches undermine customer trust and prevent businesses from operating smoothly. The emergence of cloud-computing and mobile technology, and the sheer proliferation of data about everything from your credit card information to how many steps you walked in a day, create more security challenges as well as a greater need to keep data safe.
Cigital claims to be a “full-service solution capable of leading this highly fragmented industry.” Clients include Intuit, the Department of Homeland Security, IBM, and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, which recently received a $4.7 million grant from the Department of Energy to improve cybersecurity and deter treaters to the nation’s electric grid and oil and gas infrastructure.
LLR Partners led this round. The financing will support growth in existing markets, as well as expansion into new verticals and geographic locations.
