With the TapTap wristband,  ”I love you” could one day look — and feel  – more like .. / .-.. — …- . / -.– — ..-.
The wristband, which comes in pairs , translates users’ taps into vibrations for those on the other end. It’s communication via the most simple of mechanics — touch.
“With the TapTap, we’re taking away the digital abstraction. It’s like a physical manifestation of a ‘Like’,”  Dmitri Gorilovsky, one of TapTap’s designers, told VentureBeat.
The idea isn’t a new one. In fact, with a few differences, TapTap  looks a lot like Tactilu , another wristband designed for so-called “remote tactile communications.” There’s also Bond, which translates tickles from one user to the wrist of another , as well the countless, often bizarre, experiments Japanese scientists have been working on. Like so:
In other words, there are lots people out there trying to bring some kind of physical layer to remote digital communication.
It’s an interesting, powerful idea, but what makes it even more compelling is the idea that devices like TapTap could give birth to entirely new forms of digital communications where touch, not words, are at the center. Morse code — or something like it — could find new, younger audiences with these new touch-centric wearables.
The idea is, of course, more than farfetched. But it’s powerful enough that the TapTap has already raised over $66,000 of the $130,000 it needs for its Kickstarter to be successful. Gorilovsky says the device should ship by next April, when buyers will pay roughly $150 for a pair of them.
