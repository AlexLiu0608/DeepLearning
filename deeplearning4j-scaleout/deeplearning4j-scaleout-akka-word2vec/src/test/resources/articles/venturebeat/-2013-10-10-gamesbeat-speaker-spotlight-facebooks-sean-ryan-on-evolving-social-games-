We’re pleased to announce that Sean Ryan, the head of game partnerships at Facebook, will describe the state of the Facebook game ecosystem in a fireside chat at our  GamesBeat 2013  conference on Oct. 29-Oct. 30 in Redwood City, Calif. Zynga hasn’t had the easiest year as social gamers move to other platforms, but other players have moved into the gap on Facebook.

Sean Ryan
I will moderate the talk, “Facebook’s evolving role in the game ecosystem.” We’ll discuss how things have changed as Facebook has adapted to mobile and its game developers have done so as well. We’ll talk about the desktop’s future, where the next big hits will come from, how developers can engage with Facebook, and the latest on Facebook’s own mobile-game publishing business.
Ryan has a rich history in the leading edge of digital technology. He helped start the digital-games division at News Corp., was the chief executive officer of LiveJournal, and was head of the teen virtual world Meez. He also worked at RealNetworks, ran Listen.com, and ran business development for SegaSoft Networks in the early days of online games.

Our theme for the conference is the “Battle Royal,” where all companies compete across platforms, territories, digital and physical markets, and categories of games.
We’ve entered an era where many firms are vying for gamers’ time in the same space. Apple and Google want to get in the living room and are waging war against Nintendo and Sony. Microsoft already has an edge in living room entertainment with its Xbox Live service, but it wants a piece of mobile as well. It’s a confusing time for gamemakers. Where should they take their titles? Which platforms will provide the best experiences? Who will make them the most money?
Register here.
We’ll roll out a steady drumbeat of speakers as we get closer to GamesBeat 2013′s October date. We expect to have more than 80 of the gaming industry’s best lined up for our fifth annual event.
Each year, GamesBeat follows a big trend. In 2009, we focused on how “All The World’s a Game,” with the explosion of games on the global stage. In 2010, GamesBeat@GDC focused on “Disruption 2.0.” In 2011, our theme was “Mobile Games Level Up,” investigating the busy intersection of games and mobile technology. In 2012, we  explored “The Crossover Era ,” the time when so many big game companies and startups were transforming themselves by expanding from one market to the next. Our judges, meanwhile, are already busy picking the finalists in the Who’s Got Game Innovation Showdown for the best game startup.
As companies adapt to change, we’re witnessing disruption, adaptation, consolidation, innovation, and the arrival of big money. We’re talking billions of dollars that are at stake. We’re expecting 400 notables from throughout the game industry — social, mobile, online, and console. Please join us.
