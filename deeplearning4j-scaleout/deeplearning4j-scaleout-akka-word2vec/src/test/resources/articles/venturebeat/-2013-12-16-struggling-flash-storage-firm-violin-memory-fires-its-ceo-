Flash storage firm Violin Memory  has let go chief executive Don Basile in a bid to turn its fortunes around after a disappointing IPO.
Howard A. Bain III, the chairman of its board, was named interim chief executive in a press release Monday. Since the news was announced, Violin’s stock has risen just over 20 percent.
The news release confirms Bain’s appointment, but does not offer an explanation for the turnover. According to a report  in AllThingsD, rumors of Basile’s replacement have been spreading for days in enterprise circles.
Having priced at $9 a share, Violin Memory opened for trading on Sept. 27 at $7.50, and raised $162 million in the process. Its shares have fallen by nearly 70 percent. Since then, the company’s performance has continued to suffer.
Violin reported heavy losses in a November earnings report , which were far lower than analysts expected. Violin’s net losses jumped to $34.1 million, or 85 cents a share, from $25.4 million a year ago.
Before its IPO, expectations were sky-high for Santa Clara, Calif.-based Violin Memory, which raised over $180 million in venture capital for its high-performance flash-based storage solution.
However, PrivCo, which analyzes private companies, recently said it is concerned at the rate at which Violin is burning through cash. PrivCo issued concerns that Violin Memory has few customers, and it is late to the flash memory party.
Indeed, the space is flooded with rivals. Violin has to compete to win customers against developers of all-flash storage arrays or hybrid flash-disk arrays, including Mountain View, Calif,-based  Pure Storage , and Boulder, Colo.-based  SolidFire .
Meanwhile, another competitor Nimble Storage experienced a soaring IPO, and market sentiment is positive.
