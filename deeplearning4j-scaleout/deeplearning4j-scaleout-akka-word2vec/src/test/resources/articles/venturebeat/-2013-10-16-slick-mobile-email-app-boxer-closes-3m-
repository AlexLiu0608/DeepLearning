Boxer , a mobile e-mail client for iOS, just finalized a $3 million round of funding, the startup revealed to VentureBeat today.
Boxer’s app is built for people who have high volume inboxes. It enables you to quickly and easily get through a ton of messages via its simple touch navigation — meaning you swipe e-mail messages to either trash, archive, or reply quickly. It also manages to do things that previously were only available via desktop app clients, such  sending attachment files from a variety of cloud locker services like Box or DropBox. It currently supports all the major e-mail clients (Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud, AOL, etc.), which makes it far more useful than its closest competitor, the Dropbox-owned Mailbox .
“Mobile e-mail is all about attention,” Boxer CEO Andrew Eye said in an interview with VentureBeat. “And it’s having that attention, along  with a better mousetrap for email usage, that gives us so many opportunities to become invaluable to our users.”
Right now Boxer offers a free and paid version of its mobile app , but the company has yet to flesh out other opportunities for making money.
Eye said the startup plans to use the new capital to eventually build an Android version of its service as well as hire more people to its design and engineering teams. But for the immediate future, Boxer wants to continue refining and developing its e-mail client to bring the best experience for its users.
Boxer, which was previously called Taskbox before merging with the Boxer team, has raised a total of $3.8 million in funding. The latest round was led by Sutter Hill Ventures, with participation from previous investors. As part of the funding deal, Sutter Hill Ventures managing partner Sam Pullara will join Boxer’s board.
