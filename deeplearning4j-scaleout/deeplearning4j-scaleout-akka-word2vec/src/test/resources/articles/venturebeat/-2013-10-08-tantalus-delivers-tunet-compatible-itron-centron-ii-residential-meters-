Garland Power & Light among first to utilize new under-glass remote       disconnect/reconnect and AMI features
RALEIGH, N.C.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 8, 2013–
Tantalus ,       a leading provider of smart grid communications, today announced the       commercial availability of the factory-integrated, TUNet-compatible       Itron CENTRON II meter, equipped with Tantalus communication modules.       The meter joins the full suite of Tantalus and Itron compatible products       for residential and commercial applications for the municipal and       cooperative public power market.
The high-performance meter will allow utilities to immediately utilize       real-time interval meter reading, outage/restoral notification, voltage       data, tamper detection and remote disconnect/reconnect functionality for       residential electric customers. In addition, the new communications       module is capable of receiving TUNup™ over-the-air firmware upgrades.       This operational cost-saving feature will be utilized to implement       reading support functionality for Itron electric, water, and gas ERT       modules, providing a seamless integration between TUNet endpoints,       servers, and existing billing systems. This innovation allows electric       utilities to preserve their existing investments in handheld and drive       by AMR infrastructure.
Garland Power & Light is one of the first utilities to deploy the new       CENTRON II meter and to utilize its newly enhanced feature set. “We’ve       determined that the reliability and range of features offered by the       combination of CENTRON II meters with TUNet is the best fit to support       our AMI pilot project, said Jonas Whitehead, Distribution Manager at       Garland Power & Light. “For this pilot, our billing operations require       rapid and reliable meter data collection for both remote       reconnects/disconnects and billing inquiries.”
The robust, bi-directional metering capabilities of the CENTRON II will       enable utilities to support advanced programs such as distributed and       co-generation applications and dynamic pricing schedules. The remote       service disconnect-reconnect switch includes a load sensing feature with       full two-way communication, resulting in fewer trips to the field and       reduced operational expense. Newly enhanced remote firmware upgrade       capabilities will also reduce truck rolls and manual processes while       improving system reliability and responsiveness.
“The delivery of the Itron-Tantalus CENTRON II meter represents a       significant milestone in the joint partnership,” said Tammy Zucco,       Tantalus Chief Marketing Officer. “The tremendous level of market demand       that we’ve already seen for this product is another clear indicator of       the validity of the partnership and of our collaborative offering for       public power.”
“With our new joint offering, Itron and Tantalus are delivering true       value to the municipal and cooperative public power markets,” said Lou       Gust, Itron’s vice president of Sales and Marketing electricity in North       America. “Together, we are supporting the needs of utilities, like       Garland Power & Light, with flexible, scalable and economically       justifiable solutions.”
In 2011, Itron and Tantalus partnered to offer a joint migration path to       two-way AMI for municipal and cooperative utilities in North and Central       America and the Caribbean. The companies recently announced their first       joint win in Alabama at fiber-enabled Opelika Power Services. OPS joined       the rapidly growing domestic and international Itron-Tantalus customer       base which includes utilities like Appalachian Electric Cooperative       (AEC), Piedmont Municipal Power Agency (PMPA) and Guyana Power & Light       (GPL). The joint solution is designed to utilize existing infrastructure       where possible to extend the value of those investments and to enable       utilities to dynamically view and manage grid performance, proactively       diagnose and resolve problems like outages, and automate many       operational processes resulting in improved customer service.
