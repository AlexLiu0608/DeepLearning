SAN FRANCISCO — This morning, Google+ is bringing two important features to its platform: attribution and post embedding.
These feature might seem small, but it prevents a ton of media law kerfuffles over ownership and copyright.
“This is an incredible way to empower contributors on your platforms,” said Googler Seth Sternberg onstage.
The attribution feature, which links Google+ login with Google Authorship, won’t just apply to Google+ posts but also to anywhere you login with Google+, including platforms like WordPress, Typepad, Google Search, and many others.
This feature is launching to a small group of partners today. “We hope to be able to open this more widely soon,” said Sternberg.
Attribution in Google+ and the Google Authorship program have been around for a while, but linking authors to their Google+ profiles is new. Starting today, anything you publish can be linked to your Google+ profile.
Also new today is embedding. From a Google statement on the feature:
With embedded posts, site owners can now add your public Google+ posts to their web pages — as a primary source, for example, or to highlight your point of view. Text, photo and media posts are all supported, and the embeds are fully interactive, so visitors can +1, comment and follow you inline.
“We want to help those people get discovered [by] users across the Internet,” said Sternberg. “This ties that conversation together in one seamless experience.”
These features also give developers a reason to include Google+ login support for their sites and apps — one of the most important initiatives for the still-growing Google+ network.
Embed options are found next to every Google+ post in a drop-down menu.
Here’s what it all looks like:
