Company strengthens strategic focus on specialized medical device       solutions for Emerging Therapies provided by its California Center of       Excellence
CAMPBELL, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–October 22, 2013–
Creganna-Tactx Medical, a global Top 10 provider of medical device       outsourcing solutions, will showcase the expertise of its California Center of Excellence for Emerging Therapies at the Transcatheter       Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) conference in San Francisco,       California.
The largest provider of outsourced product design & development       solutions on the West Coast, the company’s California facility is the       partner of choice for medical device companies developing breakthrough       products for emerging minimally invasive therapies. A single-site       solution, the Campbell Center of Excellence provides all of the services       and expertise to deliver an approved medical device to market on behalf       of its customers.
“Emerging therapies hold enormous commercial potential for our       customers” explains David O’Keeffe, Global VP of Sales & Marketing at       Creganna-Tactx Medical. “For example, the global Transcatheter Aortic       Valve Replacement (TAVR) market is estimated to reach more than $1.5bn       by 2015. Over 40 companies are developing novel therapies for the       potential $2bn renal denervation market, while next generation       technologies such as bioabsorbable stents are forecast to triple yearly       growth for the next 5 years.”
“The potential rewards are significant, but developing new categories of       devices for emerging therapies is a highly challenging process. Our       customers are breaking new ground. Choosing a knowledgeable       commercialization partner with specialist insight accelerates that       journey to market. Our Campbell team has played a remarkable role in       partnering with pioneering companies to get these highly complex       products into the hands of physicians faster and more efficiently.”
To celebrate the achievements of the Campbell Center of Excellence, an       informal gathering of customers and those involved in device innovation       throughout the Bay area will be held during TCT 2013. New company CEO,       Chip Hance, will host the evening along with the company’s previous CEO,       Chairman, Management & Campbell site team for a meet and greet event. To       register for the event on Wednesday, October 30th please       visit www.cregannaevents.com
