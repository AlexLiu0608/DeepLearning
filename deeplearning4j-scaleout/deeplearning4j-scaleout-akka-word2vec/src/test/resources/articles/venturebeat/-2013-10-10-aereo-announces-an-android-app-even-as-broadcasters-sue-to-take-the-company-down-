Aereo  isn’t letting a little thing like getting sued by everyone get in the way of its product roadmap.
The company, which streams and records over-the-air local television content,  announced today that it’s launching an Android app . Available on October 22nd, the app will only be available to those in areas where Aereo is operating. So far, these areas include NYC, Boston, Atlanta, Salt Lake City, Miami, Houston, and Dallas.
The move is a big deal for the company, which should be able to better convince more people to sign up for its service if it creates an app for the platform that most of them are using.
But as clever as Aereo’s approach is, it hasn’t been clever enough to sway major broadcasters, who say that the company is infringing on their copyrights by rebroadcasting their content without permission.  The most recent pushback came from Utah broadcasters , who are arguing that very thing.
“No amount of technological gimmickry by Aereo changes the fundamental principle of copyright law that those who wish to retransmit copyrighted broadcasts may do so only with the copyright owners‟ authority,” they said in a suit filed on Tuesday.
In spite of all the ligation, Aereo’s legal grounding remains largely solid, and the company is not only still in business,  but it’s also growing rapidly . And you can bet that today’s Android app announcement is only strengthening broadcasters’ resolve to take Aereo down.
