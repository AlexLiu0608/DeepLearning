New start up says Apple Cards didn’t go far enough. Acavano brings the       greeting card display to you and mails a personalized card for $1.49       plus stamp.
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–November 14, 2013–
What if you never had to remember a Birthday, Anniversary, or other       occasion? Then, what if you never had to browse, fill out and mail a       greeting card for that occasion again? What if a card just went out       automatically, every year? And all for $1.49, plus first class stamp?       Welcome to Acavano.
What is Acavano? Acavano is the world’s first automated greeting card       company. Real Cards…Real Simple! And its ambitious plans are to change       the way we all browse, fill out and mail real cards — a game changer in       the greeting card industry. Through https://www.acavano.com/ you personalize your contacts, set your preferences and save your       occasion. The offshoot of that saved occasion is that you no longer need       a birthday or other occasion reminder but more importantly, a       personalized Card is mailed out to your recipient automatically each       year with signature and optional message in your handwriting style as if       you had taken your own pen to it.
Since officially launching a bit more than week ago, Acavano has       attracted nearly 5,000 members with no advertising and relying on word       of mouth referral. Many believe Acavano’s unique business model of       convenience and price has similarities to Amazon books by mail and       Netflix DVD by mail original models. However, Acavano’s founding may       date back prior to Netflix when a highly inconvenient and expensive trip       to the drugstore for a greeting card purchase sparked an idea to deliver       a card in a more convenient and less expensive fashion — a fashion that       hasn’t really changed in over 50 years and dominated by Hallmark and       American Greetings until now.
Acavano has been quietly developing its technology and full greeting       card library ( https://www.acavano.com/sample-cards )       to compete in a multi-billion dollar industry that even Apple has       attempted to compete in but humbly bowed out of after canceling its       ‘Cards’ App in September 2013. Acavano has managed to deliver all this       through self funding its operations working frugally from Starbucks and       saving office rent and utilizing free wifi so that patents could be       filed, and programmers and greeting card designers could be paid. With       the technologies it has developed, Acavano plans to enter the gift       market with the same automation and personalization for its users.
And with all this going on, Acavano has worked around the clock the past       24 hours to bring https://www.acavano.com/love a website where you can send a greeting card to a loved one and ALL       proceeds from the card sale will go to the Philippine relief effort. An       effort Acavano says demands its full attention now. Acavano’s message       here is simple: “Give the True Gift of Love this Holiday Season.”
