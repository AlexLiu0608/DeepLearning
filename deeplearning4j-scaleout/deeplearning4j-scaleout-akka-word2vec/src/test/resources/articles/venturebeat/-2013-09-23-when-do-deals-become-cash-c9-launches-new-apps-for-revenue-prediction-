Making money is only part of businesses’ financial challenge. The other part is predicting when deals become cash. This week, revenue performance firm C9 took the wraps off two new analytical applications that help in predicting and optimizing revenue – and announced it has obtained a new round of funding and a new CEO.
Currently, C9 helps businesses like Box, LinkedIn, and Stanley Black & Decker to generate forecasts and predict risks in the sales pipeline. Its platform and related apps mash up and derive new data from front-office applications and apply predictive analytics to generate recommendations, such as identifying the top sales-driving opportunities.
Active forecast, active insights
New from the San Mateo, Calif.-based company are the apps Active Forecast and Active Insights, plus new capabilities for its Active Data Platform.
Active Forecast applies sales judgments to historical pipeline trends, coming up with predictions for rates of deal closings – which data then helps drive more accuracy in subsequent forecasts. The app automatically draws on the sales hierarchy in CRM systems, which the company said makes it quick to deploy and adapt to various kinds of organizations. Active Insights provides prebuilt, ready-to-use dashboards and reports that monitor pipeline changes and employ past trends to scan for possible risks.
C9 is also launching 27 new Active Data Platform functions, including device-independent reporting, a 200 percent boost in data replication performance, a performance increase in query optimization and real-time push notification on deals-to-watch.
In support of these rollouts and others, C9 has received a $12 million Series D round funding from existing funders, bringing the total raised thus far to $40 million. The money will go toward sales, marketing and engineering. The new CEO is Michael Howard, formerly VP of marketing at Greenplum, EMC’s Big Data division, as well as ex-CEO of Ingrian Networks and VP of Data Warehousing at Oracle.
