A side view of Square’s newest credit card reader dongle.
Mobile payments startup Square  rolled out a new version of its credit card reader today, which offers some notable improvements over the previous model.
Square, which first teased the news yesterday via Twitter, debuted the new reader in a Vine video from Square user  Blue Bottle Coffee earlier today. As you can see from the video (embedded below), the new reader is thinner than the old version and has sharper edges.
The most important change to the new reader is a redesigned 3.5mm audio input plug, which means the new Square reader should be much easier to use on a variety of devices.
The new reader isn’t available in retail stores until next year, but you can order one via Square’s website today.
