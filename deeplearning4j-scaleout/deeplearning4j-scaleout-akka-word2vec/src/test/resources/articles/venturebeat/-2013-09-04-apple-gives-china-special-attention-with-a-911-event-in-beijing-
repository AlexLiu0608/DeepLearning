Apple will be holding a separate, standalone event in Beijing, China the day after its September 10 event here in Cupertino, Calif.
Could it be that the fastest-growing mobile market is finally getting the attention it deserves?
Apple sent out invites for the U.S.  September 10 event yesterday , at which we’ll likely see the company’s new flagship iPhone 5S (or maybe even the 6), the new multicolored iPhone 5C , and probably a number of other products, including — just maybe — an iWatch . It’s the company’s big opportunity to show that it is still the leader of the post-PC revolution.
Adding a special event in China — which the company has never done before — highlights China’s importance in global markets.
And, it highlights that Apple has in many ways become an also-ran in the country that bought 33 percent of all global smartphones last quarter . In spite of early Chinese lust for shiny iDevices , Apple’s iPhone is only the seventh best-selling phone in China. Being late to market with a cheaper iPhone that’s more accessible for developing nations means that Apple sales were down $800 million year-over-year, and $3.6 billion quarter-over-quarter  in its 2013 Q3 results.
In other words, Apple is sinking in a rising tide.
The event will hopefully help Apple convince Chinese mobile carrier giant China Mobile — the world’s biggest, with 700+ million subscribers — to finally offer the iPhone, something Apple has been working on for years . Apple CEO Tim Cook has taken two trips to China so far in 2013, and the announcement of such a deal would be a major, major coup that would have an immediate impact on Apple’s stock price and future potential.
The event will be held at Beijing’s World Trade Center — an uneasy resonance, given the date.
