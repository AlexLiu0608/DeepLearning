Friday’s funding was fulled with some really important industries that are truly being transformed by tech: health care and education.
Coursera, a company that provides massive open online courses to anyone in the world received an extra $20 million in funding for its second round. And Genophen, a healthcare company that will study your behaviors, environment, and genes to figure out what diseases you might develop, got $2 million in its third round.
