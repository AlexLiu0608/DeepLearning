Learn-to-code company Treehouse is announcing a truly awesome promotion for its customers.
Every time someone signs up for a new Gold-level account ($50 per month), Treehouse will give an account to a public school student — most likely a student who would never otherwise have the opportunity to learn to code inside the public school system.
As has been well documented by organizations like Code.org, public high schools in general have  little or no computer science curriculum . Treehouse, which has a history of bringing computer science to  underprivileged schools and at-risk students , has the expertise and connections to make sure the buy-one-give-one program benefits those most in need.
“Our hope is that together we can end the days when only overachieving students in schools wealthy enough to have a computer science teacher on their faculty have access to programming classes,” said Treehouse cofounder Alan Johnson in a statement on the news.
“Every student deserves a chance. Let’s make it happen!”
Some compelling stats: American Treehouse students who use the company’s online education tools for six months or longer reported earning $10,000 more per year compared to new students.
And Treehouse doesn’t just teach coding; there’s also a cornucopia of courses on design, business, etc. The company said that American Treehouse students who learn web design earn an average of $73,000 per year — a full 41 percent higher than the national average.
Let’s be honest: You’ve been meaning to learn to code (or learn a new language or pick up some design skills) for at least a few months now. It’s probably on your New Year’s resolutions list. If you’re going to take the plunge, you might as well do it in a way that helps change people’s lives (and helps the economy).
And if you already know everything there is to know about code, design, and business, you might consider giving a Treehouse account as a gift. That way, everyone profits from your generosity, you overachieving genius, you.
Treehouse was founded in 2011 and has raised $19.4 million in venture funding to date.
