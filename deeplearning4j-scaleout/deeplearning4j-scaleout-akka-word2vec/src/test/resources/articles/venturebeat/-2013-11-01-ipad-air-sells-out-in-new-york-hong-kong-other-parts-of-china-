Apple’s iPad Air and iPad Mini launch seems to be going very well indeed.
The new Air is available in 42 countries on launch day, the most ever, and initial reports on sales are very positive. Sales in Hong Kong are almost at a standstill after local Apple stores sold out, and shipping times across China are jumping up to between five to 10 days — a good sign for Apple’s efforts to boost sales in that country, after  Apple sales were down $800 million year-over-year, and $3.6 billion quarter-over-quarter , in its 2013 Q3 results
Similar things are happening in New York, according to Brian White of Cantor Fitzgerald .
“One of the stores has already sold out of all 16GB and all 128GB iPad Air models, while another store indicated that stock for all Wi-Fi + Cellular models with AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile are getting very low,” White said in a research note this morning. “Another store indicated that all iPad Air models with Sprint are sold out, and certain models with Verizon are sold out already.”
