Jimdo , a Hamburg, Germany-based company that offers tools for easy website creation, is now hitting mobile in a big way with the launch of a new iOS app.
Available for both the iPhone and iPad , the free Jimdo app enables you create websites for free as well as edit existing sites on the service.
Naturally, there’s no coding necessary: You simply choose the site template you want to use, drag and drop design elements, and input some text. Jimdo is something you can turn to after you outgrow your Tumblr blog — its designs look more professional and not like some tween’s animated GIF blog.
In addition to free sites, Jimdo also offers a premium plan for more control and features ( $90 a year) and a business plan that  offers e-commerce tools ($240 per year).
As of February, the company’s sixth anniversary, customers have created more than eight million websites, Jimdo’s U.S. chief executive. The company has been profitable since 2009 (it offers a premium product), and last year it publicly turned down an eight-figure venture capital round .
In my brief testing, I was surprised at how quickly I was able to create a Jimdo site. Upon first launching the app, you simply need a Jimdo account and choose a website theme, a process that took me less than two minutes. Once that’s done, you’ll have a publicly accessible website (username.jimdo.com), which you can also edit from Jimdo’s online tools. Certain advanced design features, like adding columns, can only be done from the web, not the new mobile apps.
Jimdo now has 170 employees spread across four countries, and many focus on customer service. Jimdo currently supports 12 languages, and while it has a significant European base, it’s also growing quickly in Japan. Belomy tells me about 20 percent of Jimdo’s users are based in the U.S.
The company is now seeing more than 10 percent of traffic to its sites coming from mobile devices, which was one of the reasons it decided to build a mobile app of its own. According to Belomy, an Android version is also in the works.
