Enmetric       Systems, Inc. , the leading provider of plug load management       solutions for the enterprise, today announced it has closed on a $1.5       million follow-on financing led by Navitas       Capital with participation from new investors including Azure       International , Lakewest,       Inc. (Belgravia Group, Ltd.) , and several prominent angel investors.
The financing round will accelerate Enmetric’s rollout of its       data-driven, plug load management solutions which, in practice, enable       enterprises to monitor, control and reduce energy use and cost. Chris       Raczkowski , Managing Director of Azure International, will serve on       Enmetric’s board of directors as an observer.
“A growing number of the world’s largest and best run companies are       requesting data-driven solutions to help manage and optimize their       facilities. Plug loads represent the largest opportunity in enterprise       energy management, and Enmetric is delivering a ‘best in class’       solution, leveraging our scalable, cloud-based wireless architecture.       Importantly, Enmetric is uniquely positioned, as we can provide       data-driven solutions across the Enterprise,” said Jake Masters ,       Founder and CEO of Enmetric.
In addition, Enmetric announced that Steve Capelli, a former President       at Sybase (an SAP Company), participated in the round, joined its Board       of Directors, and will join the operating team in an advisory role.       “What’s exciting about Enmetric is that we now have a technology for the       enterprise that addresses how individuals can easily contribute to cost       savings and asset management for the enterprise without giving up       control –- and it’s measurable too,” said Capelli.
“As an investor and advisor to Enmetric, I’m excited to welcome Steve to       Enmetric’s Board and our new strategic capital partners to the table,”       added Brad       Buss , CFO of Cypress Semiconductor and Board Member of Tesla       Motors . “Adding Steve’s track record of building and managing a       billion dollar-plus sales operation in the enterprise software space       comes at the perfect time as we begin to accelerate Enmetric’s growth.”
