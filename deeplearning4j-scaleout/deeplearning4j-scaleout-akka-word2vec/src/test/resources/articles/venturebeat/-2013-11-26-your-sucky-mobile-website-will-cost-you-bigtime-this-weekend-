Call it the glitch that stole Christmas (and Hanukkah). Your sucky mobile app or site with the ridiculous load time and confusing transaction flow is going to kill you on Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
We already know it’s going to be a billion-plus dollar day for online retailers, and that a ton of that cash is going to come through on mobile devices, including tablets.
So why are you letting it suck? Do you not like money? What is wrong with you?
To give you the benefit of the doubt, we’re assuming it doesn’t suck on purpose. Here are some handy stats to convince you that a tweak here and there for your mobile experience is very much worthwhile, especially during the greediest time of the year.
Now go out there and bag you some consumers!
