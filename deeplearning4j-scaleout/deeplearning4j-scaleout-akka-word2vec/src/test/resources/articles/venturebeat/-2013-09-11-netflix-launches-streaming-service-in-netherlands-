Netflix is continuing its expansion into Europe with the launch of its streaming video service in the Netherlands, the company announced today.
Netflix’s Netherlands expansion, which was announced back in June, is part of the company’s overall business strategy to bring its service to foreign markets using profits from its domestic business. The company has already launched successful expansions into Canada, the U.K. , Ireland , Latin America , Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Finland. In the past, entrance into new markets caused Netflix’s overall profits to dip, which wasn’t popular among investors, but the company said it plans to slow down now that its added service in this particular region.
The move makes sense for Netflix, which is quickly trying to assert itself as the premiere streaming video service before others claim these markets. For instance, HBO launched a standalone streaming service (meaning you don’t need to subscribe to cable to access it) in Scandinavia last year, and rival service LoveFilm (owned by Amazon) already has quite a big presence in Europe.
“We’re proud to bring the future of television to the Netherlands,” said Netflix CEO Reed Hastings in a statement. “The Dutch have incredible broadband, but until today have not been able to take full advantage of their fast connections.”
Much like with other international expansions, the content library won’t necessarily be the same as it is in the U.S., as Netflix must negotiate content licensing separately for each region. The service itself is available today and will cost €7.99 ($10.60) per month for access. Including the Netherlands, Netflix now offers service in 41 different countries.
