If you follow VentureBeat but don’t regularly check our GamesBeat site, here’s a list of the best video game stories we ran over the last seven days that you may have missed.
This week, GamesBeat 2013 tackles some of the game industry’s biggest topics, including the Oculus Rift, Ouya, and casino games; the FAA lifts restrictions on when passengers can use electronic devices on flights; and Sony released a list of frequently asked questions about the PlayStation 4 that outlines what the system will and won’t do (like how it won’t stream content from PCs, something the older PS3 does).
