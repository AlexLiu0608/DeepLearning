We’re thrilled to announce that GitHub co-founder and CEO Tom Preston-Werner will be speaking at DevBeat, taking place November 12-13, 2013, in San Francisco.
DevBeat is VentureBeat’s first-ever developer conference for motivated, mid-career developers. At the show, you’ll get hands-on experience with the latest tools and technologies, as well as insights from community leaders (like Tom) on how to take your career to the next level. This isn’t just a bunch of panels and fireside chats — we want to make sure that everything at DevBeat is useful in your everyday work and life.
Speaking of which, when you buy your ticket , make sure to expense that bad boy — you’ll be doing more than enough learning, hacking, networking, and career development to justify it. If any questions come up, have your boss call us directly.Tom Preston-Werner, who will be giving our Day One keynote, is a software developer and entrepreneur who co-founded GitHub in 2008, along with Chris Wanstrath and PJ Hyett, to simplify sharing code and make it easy to collaborate on building software.
Today, GitHub is the largest code host in the world, with a community of four million people building software together. Before founding GitHub, Tom worked as a Ruby developer for Powerset, a Wikipedia search engine that was acquired by Microsoft. Additionally, Tom invented Gravatar, a service for providing unique avatars that follow you from site to site, which he sold to Automattic in 2007.
Stay tuned for a bunch of DevBeat program and speaker announcements over the coming weeks, and make sure to register today! The room is filling up quickly with hackers of all kinds, so get your friends/coworkers/arch-nemeses together and get tickets while the gettin’s good.
Thanks to the following industry leaders for supporting DevBeat: Ford and Pivotal as Platinum Partners; IBM as Gold Partner; and PayPal as Silver Partner.
