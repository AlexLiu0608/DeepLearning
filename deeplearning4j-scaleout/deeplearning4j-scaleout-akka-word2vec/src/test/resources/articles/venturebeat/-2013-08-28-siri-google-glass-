Hell hath no fury like a virtual assistant scorned. Siri is pissed that you think you can call her Google Glass and get away with it, and she’s got the attitude to prove it.
If you’re not afraid your iPhone’s voice-activated assistant is secretly storing memories of your interactions for The Singularity, then go ahead and say, “OK, Glass” to Siri. She’ll respond with some colorful commentary on Google’s wearable eyeglass gadget Google Glass.
“OK, Glass” is the verbal command for Google Glass, which has only been given out to developers and those testers in Explorer Program. Siri will respond with snarky comment, like, “I think that glass is half-empty,” and “Stop trying to strap me to your forehead. It won’t work.”
It seems Apple doesn’t mind quietly poking fun at the competition. The Verge says that while these are available in iOS 6, its latest mobile operating system, iOS 7 comes packed with even more commentary.
If you’re testing iOS 7 and come across a funny one, send us an e-mail!
