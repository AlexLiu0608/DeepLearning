# Overview 

Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. Deep learning is a name for a certain type of stacked neural network composed of several node layers. Each layer's output is simultaneously the subsequent layer's input, starting from an initial input layer.  

Deep-learning networks are distinguished from the more commonplace single hidden layer neural networks by their depth; that is, the number of node layers through which data is passed in a multistep process of pattern recognition. Three or more intermediate layers between input and output is deep learning. Anything less is simply machine learning. 

In deep-learning networks, each layer of nodes -- which are the analogous equivalent of neurons -- is pre-trained on a distinct set of features based on the previous layer's outputs. This makes deep-learning networks capable of  handling very complex data sets, including [nonlinear functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system). Above all, they are capable of discovering latent structures within unstructured data, which is the vast majority of data in the world. 

Deep-learning networks perform feature creation/extraction without human intervention, unlike most off-the-shelf machine-learning software. Each node layer of the network learns features by repeatedly trying to reconstruct a training set, attempting to minimize the difference between the network's output and an established benchmark, the training set. 

In the process, these networks come to recognize correlations between certain relevant features and optimal results. A trained deep-learning network can then be applied to unstructured data. This is beyond the scope of traditional machine learning.

Deep-learning networks end in an output layer: a logistic, or softmax, classifier that assigns a likelihood to a particular outcome. That is, given raw data, a deep-learning network might generate output indicating that the input data is 90 percent likely to represent a person. 

The documentation below will show you how to set up, and train with sample data, several types of deep-learning networks, including single- and multithread versions of the networks, [Restricted Boltzmann machines](../restrictedboltzmannmachine.html), [deep-belief networks](../deepbeliefnetwork.html) and [Stacked Denoising Autoencoders](../stackeddenoisingautoencoder.html).
